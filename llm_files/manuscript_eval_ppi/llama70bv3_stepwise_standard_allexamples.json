However, how these signaling axes are coordinated spatiotemporally remains unclear. Here, the central and multifaceted roles of the BCH domain containing protein, BNIP-2, in orchestrating the expression of two key cardiac genes (cardiac troponin T [cTnT] and cardiac myosin light chain [Myl2]) in H9c2 and human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes are delineated. This study shows that BNIP-2 mRNA and protein expression increase with the onset of cTnT and Myl2 and promote the alignment of H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, BNIP-2 is required for the inactivation of YAP through YAP phosphorylation and its cytosolic retention. Turbo-ID proximity labeling corroborated by super-resolution analyses and biochemical pulldown data reveals a scaffolding role of BNIP-2 for LATS1 to phosphorylate and inactivate YAP in a process that requires BNIP-2 activation of cellular contractility. The findings identify BNIP-2 as a pivotal signaling scaffold that spatiotemporally integrates RhoA/Myosin II and LATS1/YAP mechanotransduction signaling to drive cardiomyoblast differentiation, by switching the genetic programming from YAP-dependent growth to YAP-silenced differentiation. These findings offer insights into the importance of scaffolding proteins in bridging the gap between mechanical and biochemical signals in cell growth and differentiation and the prospects in translational applications.\n\nD.

However, in contrast to skeletal muscles, which are readily replenished by residential satellite cells, adult cardiomyocytes have limited regenerative potential. Hence, it is pertinent to the interest of translational medicine to define mechanistic pathways that integrate biochemical and mechanical signaling. The Rho GTPases and Hippo kinases pathways have emerged as crucial players during cardiomyoblast differentiation. For example, cardiac troponin is the substrate of the Rho kinase downstream of RhoA GTPases, and its regulation is important for cardiac hypertrophy. On the other hand, the Hippo pathway can also come under the regulation of Rho GTPases and has been attributed to cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart size regulation. To ensure proper regulation of the complicated relationships of these essential signaling axes.\n\nAdv. Sci. 2022, 9, 2202834\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com www.advancedscience.com\n\nWe hypothesize that a molecular scaffold is required to orchestrate their signaling activities with spatial and temporal precision. However, any detailed mechanistic understanding of these activities at the biochemical and molecular levels would first be interrogated with relevant cellular models so as to establish further links for in vivo studies.\n\nThe H9c2 cardiomyoblast is a valuable in vitro model to delineate mechanical and molecular events that are spatiotemporally coordinated during cardiomyoblast differentiation. H9c2 cells show high similarities to primary cardiomyocytes, including induction of cardiac genes, cytoskeletal rearrangement and hypertrophy response. Furthermore, H9c2 has been established as an invaluable in vitro model for various cardiac pathophysiological studies including cardiac toxicity testing and ischemia-reperfusion therapeutic interventions. Hence, this study aims to unveil the spatiotemporal coordination of any molecular events that permit induction of cardiac genes in H9c2 cells, so as to provide novel conceptual insights for future cardiac-related studies in vitro and in vivo.\n\nThe small GTPase RhoA is an upstream regulator of myosin II-dependent contractility. Its activation has been shown to increase actomyosin-based cellular contractility for mechanotransduction, heart development and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in mature cardiomyocytes. However, the modes of action of Rho GTPases in the regulation of cardiac gene expressions are still unclear. RhoA-mediated generation of actomyosin contractility is a mechanical stimulus that regulates Hippo-kinase pathway and in turn, influences cell fate by altering subcellular localization of the transcriptional coactivator YAP. The canonical Hippo-kinase pathway consists of MST and LATS, which phosphorylates the transcription coregulators YAP to inactivate and sequester YAP in the cytoplasm. The core kinases, MST and LATS, are sequentially phosphorylated for their activation. However, increasing evidences suggest that cytoskeleton integrity and cellular contractility promotes YAP nuclear localization independent of LATS in nonmuscle cells (e.g., epithelial cells and fibroblasts). In the heart, activation of YAP in cardiomyocytes stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation and is responsible for cardiac regeneration. However, heart development and regeneration involve a biphasic phase of proliferation and physiological hypertrophy that is accompanied by increased generation of contractile force. Such delicate regulation of mechanical and biochemical signals during cardiomyoblast differentiation may spatiotemporally regulate YAP intracellular localization for heart gene expression. In addition, how mechanotransduction through Rho GTPases and the core Hippo kinase cascade are integrated in the context of cardiomyoblast differentiation is still obscure.\n\nBNIP-2 is a BCH domain-containing scaffold protein that controls cell morphogenesis, motility, and differentiation. The BCH domain is an evolutionarily conserved subset of the CRAL_TRIO/Sec14p superfamily. BCH domain-containing proteins can form homodimers and heterodimers with other BCH domain-containing proteins and have been demonstrated as a versatile scaffold that regulates small GTPases MAPK and metabolic signaling and that it engages Rho via a novel Rho-binding and lipid-binding motif. Recently, BNIP-2 has been reported to be a scaffold protein which engage GEF-H1 to regulate RhoA activation and cell migration in cancer cells. In addition, BNIP-2 is important for skeletal muscle differentiation by CDO-dependent p38MAPK activation. However, whether and how BNIP-2 participates as a scaffold protein during cardiomyoblast differentiation is unknown. As YAP is a mechanosensitive transcriptional coactivator, we hypothesize that BNIP-2 regulates RhoA activity and actomyosin-based contractility upstream of Hippo-kinase pathway to regulate cardiac gene expression.\n\nIn this study, we delineated the central and multifaceted roles of BNIP-2 in integrating mechanical and biochemical signaling for cardiomyoblast differentiation. We showed that BNIP-2 mRNA and protein expression are upregulated and precedes the fetal heart gene expression in both models of H9c2 cardiomyoblast and human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocyte (hESC-CM). BNIP-2 depletion severely delayed this process, which was accompanied by reduced contractile force and the activation of several key target genes of YAP (e.g., CTGF and Myc). With a combination of biochemical analyses corroborated by biophysical and super-resolution analyses, we show that BNIP-2 activation of RhoA was responsible for the increased actomyosin-based intracellular contractility and extracellular traction force. The activation of intracellular force subsequently led to BNIP-2 scaffolding of LATS1 with YAP in the cytoplasm. Such scaffolding effect directly induced LATS1 to phosphorylate YAP, preventing its nuclear entry, thereby switching the genetic programming from YAP-dependent growth to cardiomyoblast differentiation. Our findings therefore reveal a pivotal role of BNIP-2 as a signaling scaffold that spatially and temporally integrates RhoA/Myosin II (mechanical signaling) and MST/LATS/YAP (biochemical signaling) as key mechanotransduction axes to enable cardiac gene expression and cardiomyoblast differentiation.\n\n# Results\n\n# Induction of Cardiac Gene Expressions in H9c2 Cardiomyoblast Correlates with Increased BNIP-2 Expression\n\nTo investigate the importance of BNIP-2 for heart development, we first examined its expression profile during fetal heart development and adult heart by analyzing publicly available databases. As shown in Figure S1A,B (Supporting Information), BNIP-2 showed relatively higher expression in cells of mesoderm lineage (e.g., adipose, cardiac, and skeletal muscles), with the ventricular cardiomyocytes showing slightly higher expression compared to atrial cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, BNIP-2 expression increased during human fetal heart development and was higher compared to other tissues at week 20 (Figure S1C, Supporting Information). Since BNIP-2 showed higher expression in ventricular than atrial cardiomyocytes, we proceeded to using the neonate rat ventricular cardiomyoblast (H9c2) that responds to all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation as a model to understand whether and how BNIP-2 could affect the induction of cardiac genes (e.g., cTnT and Myl2).\n\nAs shown in Figure 1A,B, ATRA treatment induced a significant increase in BNIP-2 protein expression that paralleled the increased expression of the cardiac genes, cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and cardiac Myosin Light Chain 2 (Myl2), which are also two key components of the force generation machinery in cardiomyocytes. Consistently, quantitative real-time PCR analyses confirmed an increase in BNIP-2 mRNA (Figure 1C) with Adv. Sci. 2022, 9, 2202834\n| |Day 0|Day 2|Day 3|Day 3|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|BNIP-2| | | |55 kDa|\n|cTnt| | | |39|\n|Myl2| | | |18|\n|GAPDH| | | |37|\n\n| |Day 0|Day 3|\n|---|---|---|\n|BNIP-2| |55 kDa|\n|cTnt| |39|\n|Myl2| |18|\n|GAPDH| |37|\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com www.advancedscience.com\n\nThe increased expression of cTnT and Myl2. We corroborated these findings by confirming an elevated BNIP-2 expression in hESC-CM that preceded the activation of cTnT and Myl2 expression (Figure 2A, Supporting Information).\n\nNext, to determine whether enhanced BNIP-2 expression was essential for H9c2 cardiomyoblast differentiation, we knocked-down BNIP-2 and observed that BNIP-2 knockdown significantly reduced the expression of cTnT and Myl2 (Figure 1D,E). Conversely, overexpression of BNIP-2 enhanced the expression of cTnT and Myl2 (Figure 1F). Importantly, overexpression of BNIP-2 promoted the alignment of dispersed cardiomyocytes that expressed cTnT (Figure 2B, Supporting Information), implying the possibility that H9c2 cells that expressed cTnT and Myl2 could collectively exert extracellular forces.\n\nBNIP-2 was previously demonstrated to promote C2C12, skeletal muscle cell differentiation by CDO-dependent p38MAPK activation. We next sought to understand if the same pathway would be involved during H9c2 differentiation. Intriguingly, BNIP-2 knockdown in H9c2 cells had no significant effect on p38MAPK phosphorylation, nor did p38MAPK phosphorylation change over the course of differentiation under ATRA treatment (Figure 2C, Supporting Information). In addition, quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the surface receptor CDO revealed no significant differences in their gene expression between H9c2 cells expressing high and low levels of cTnT (Figure 2D, Supporting Information).\n\nCollectively, these results strongly suggest that BNIP-2 promotes cardiac tissue morphogenesis, synchronization of cardiomyocytes alignment and the expression of cardiogenic markers independently of the p38MAPK regulatory pathway. These results prompt us to identify the mechanistic basis by which BNIP-2 may act as a key regulator to induce cardiac gene expression in H9c2 cells.\n\n# 2.2. RNA Sequencing Revealed Aberrant Cardiac Signaling and Activation of YAP Targets in BNIP-2 Knockdown H9c2 Cells\n\nWe next performed total RNA sequencing of control H9c2 cardiomyoblast compared with BNIP-2 knockdown H9c2 cells to characterize the signaling pathways affected by BNIP-2 depletion (Figure 2A–D). Comparing control cells and BNIP-2 knockdown cells after 3 days of ATRA treatment, we observed significant differences in pathways regulating cardiac signaling (e.g., calcium signaling, cardiac hypertrophy, etc.) (Figure 2C). Interestingly, concomitant with an expected reduced expression of cardiac marker genes (cTnT and Myl2), an upregulation of YAP expression and various YAP target genes were strikingly activated in BNIP-2 knockdown H9c2 cells (Figure 2D). RT-PCR analyses further validated an enrichment of expression in several potent YAP target genes such as ctgf, myc, and axl in BNIP-2 knockdown cells (Figure 2E).\n\nTogether, these data confirmed the requirement of BNIP-2 to induce cardiac gene expression during ATRA-induced differentiation, possibly by regulating the Hippo-YAP pathway.\n\n# 2.3. YAP Is Inactivated during Cardiac Gene Induction\n\nTo test the hypothesis that YAP is inactivated for cardiomyoblast differentiation, we first verified whether LATS1, the direct inactivating kinase of YAP, was activated during cardiomyoblast differentiation. As shown in Figure 3A,B, LATS1 was activated (as shown by its phosphorylation at S909) during differentiation in both H9c2 and hESC-CM cells. This was also accompanied by increased levels of YAP phosphorylation, which is indicative of its cytoplasmic retention and inactivation. Since phosphorylated YAP accumulates in the cytoplasm, we next performed immunofluorescence to confirm the subcellular localization of YAP. Interestingly, while YAP in H9c2 and hESC cells preferentially localizes to the cytoplasm in cells expressing cTnT, hESC-CM showed a biphasic profile for YAP localization, with re-localization of YAP to the nucleus after 14 days. This could be partially explained by an increase in hESC-CM YAP expression from day 7 onward, which might have overwhelmed LATS1-dependent inactivation.\n\nSince our results indicate that differentiation and cardiac gene induction by BNIP-2 activate Hippo pathway (through LATS1 phosphorylation) to inactivate YAP (through YAP phosphorylation at serine 127), we hypothesize that BNIP-2 directly regulates YAP phosphorylation status and its localization by acting as a scaffold for YAP and LATS1. We set out to verify whether BNIP-2 knockdown could result in the accumulation of YAP in H9c2 nucleus. As expected, BNIP-2 knockdown significantly reduced YAP S127 phosphorylation and increased the accumulation of YAP in the nucleus, concomitant with reduced LATS1 phosphorylation. Next, a nonphosphorylatable YAP mutant (YAP5SA) that is refractory to LATS regulation and constitutively localized to the nucleus, was introduced to H9c2 cells. Indeed, the forced nuclear localization of YAP resulted in reduced expression of cTnT, indicative of reduced differentiation. To corroborate these observations, we performed a luciferase assay directly measuring YAP activity in control, BNIP-2 knocked down and BNIP-2 overexpressed H9c2 and HEK293T cells. As expected, knockdown and overexpression of BNIP-2 resulted in increased luciferase signal (higher YAP activity) and reduced luciferase signal (lower YAP activity), respectively.\n# log2RPKM\n\n| |D3 Ctrl vs D3|807|\n|---|---|---|\n|DO Ctrl vs D3 Ctrl:|542|973|\n|DO Ctrl vs DO KD|631|579|\n\nUp-Regulated\n\nDown-Regulated\n\nFigure 2.

Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com www.advancedscience.com\n\nTaken together, our results show that: i) BNIP-2 expression is indispensable for H9c2 and hESC-CM differentiation (as marked by cTnT and Myl2), and ii) YAP inactivation (through YAP phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization) is a pre-requisite for early cardiac gene induction. Importantly, our results strongly suggest that BNIP-2 serves as a master regulator of YAP inactivation through the activation of LATS1 during heart cell differentiation.\n\n2.4. BNIP-2 Interacts with LATS1 to Promote YAP Cytosolic Localization\n\nThe BCH domains of BNIP-2 and those present in BPGAP1, BNIP-H and BNIP-XL, are known to serve as scaffolds for small GTPases, kinases and metabolic enzymes. This raises the exciting possibility that BNIP-2 might serve as a scaffold to support the interaction between LATS1 and YAP, thus directly inactivating YAP through its phosphorylation. Notably, we found partial colocalization between BNIP-2 and LATS1 in the immunofluorescence staining of H9c2 cells (Figure 4A). To further identify the subcellular localization of BNIP-2 in relation to LATS1, we then performed super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM). We observed that LATS1 colocalized with BNIP-2 at the cell protrusions (Figure 4B), which was the intracellular location where BNIP-2 was previously reported in epithelial cells.\n\nTo examine whether BNIP-2 could directly interact with any components of the Hippo pathway or other novel regulators of YAP, we performed an unbiased Turbo-ID proximity labeling assay in culture media containing biotin and using HEK293T cells transfected with 3XHA-BNIP-2-TurboID_pCDNA3 construct as bait. Interestingly, LATS1 was identified as a putative binding partner of BNIP-2 in the mass spectrometry analysis (Figure S4A, Supporting Information), which supports our observation that BNIP-2 colocalized with LATS1 in immunofluorescence studies (Figure 4A,B). This novel and physiological interaction of LATS with BNIP-2 was further verified by confirming the presence of endogenous BNIP-2/LATS complex in H9c2 cells (Figure 4C,D) and by overexpression of Flag-tagged BNIP-2 and HA-tagged LATS1 in HEK293T cells (Figure 4E). Titration experiment with an increasing amount of BNIP-2 also showed an increased association between LATS1 and BNIP-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4F). Consistently, LATS1 upstream kinase MST1, and LATS1 substrate YAP were identified in the pull-down of BNIP-2 in the overexpression system (Figure S4D, Supporting Information).\n\nWe next generated a stable BNIP-2 knockdown HEK293T cell line to functionally determine whether BNIP-2 affects LATS1 and YAP interaction. Consistent with our hypothesis that BNIP-2 scaffolds Hippo-YAP components, knockdown of BNIP-2 significantly reduced the interaction between LATS1 and YAP (Figure 4G). On the other hand, overexpression of BNIP-2 enhanced LATS1 and YAP interaction at a dose-dependent level (Figure S4C, Supporting Information). The drop in LATS1 and YAP interaction at a high dosage of BNIP-2 is consistent with the classical demonstration of the “scaffolding” effect, namely, an optimal concentration of scaffold promotes interaction. However, too little scaffold is insufficient to bridge, whereas too much scaffold would compete with, the interactions of component proteins (Figure S4D, Supporting Information). Next, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using LATS1, YAP, and BNIP-2 and showed that BNIP-2 directly promotes YAP phosphorylation (Figure 4H). Finally, we show that increased BNIP-2 expression correlates with increased YAP phosphorylation in H9c2 cardiomyoblast (Figure 4I).\n\nCollectively, our data indicate that BNIP-2 serves as a novel scaffold necessary for the Hippo-YAP pathway signaling cascade by promoting LATS1-YAP interaction, which mediates YAP inactivation through YAP phosphorylation and its cytoplasmic retention. As a result, the growth-promoting transcriptional coactivator role of YAP is switched off (e.g., via myc and ctgf) and turns into differentiation-enabling mode via the induction of cardiac genes cTnT and Myl2.\n\n2.5. BNIP-2 Activation of Cellular Contractility Inhibits YAP Function\n\nYAP is a mechanosensitive transcription coactivator whose cytoplasmic nuclear shuttling is influenced by intracellular contractility and force exertion from the extracellular matrix. While recent studies have shown that mechanical force regulates YAP activity in cellular proliferation and fibroblast spreading by promoting its nuclear localization, little is known about whether this process is recapitulated physiologically in other tissues, especially in the heart. Furthermore, pathophysiologic findings in myocardiac infarction models have shown reduced ventricular contractile force associated with hypertrophy and YAP activation, suggesting plausible alternative models. Hence, it is pertinent to ascertain whether BNIP-2 serves a multifaceted role in activating intracellular contractile force to inactivate YAP, instead of activating it.\n\nOur results thus far showed that YAP retention in the cytoplasm is required to drive differentiation (Figure 3), and this mechanism is mediated in part by the ability of BNIP-2 to scaffold LATS1 and YAP (Figure 4). In addition, the coinduction of BNIP-2 and contractility proteins (e.g., cTnT and Myl2) (Figure 1), the alignment of H9c2 cells that over expressed BNIP-2 (Figure S2B, Supporting Information) as well as previously known function\n\nAdv.

Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com www.advancedscience.com\n\nof BCH domain as a GTPase regulator, point toward the possible role(s) of intracellular contractile force as a mechanical module regulating cardiomyoblast differentiation governed by BNIP-2. To address this, we first sought to establish whether intracellular contractility is important for differentiation. We found that adding blebbistatin, an inhibitor of nonmuscle and cardiac myosin II, significantly reduced the expression of cTnT in control and more so in BNIP-2 knockdown cells (Figure 5A). Therefore, a continuous input of cellular contractility appears to be required for differentiation. Since differentiation requires YAP inactivation through BNIP-2 through the regulation of LATS1 phosphorylation of YAP, we next examined the interaction of LATS1 and YAP, as well as BNIP-2 and LATS1 in blebbistatin-treated cells. Interestingly, inhibiting cellular contractility reduced the interactions between LATS1 and YAP, and between BNIP-2 and LATS1 (Figure 5B,C). These data strongly suggest that in cardiomyoblasts, intracellular contractility can activate the biochemical axis of the Hippo pathway, which leads to YAP inactivation. This is in stark contrast to the previously described mechanisms in fibroblasts whereby contractility promotes nuclear entry of YAP, independent of biochemical regulation.\n\nThe BCH domain of BNIP-2 is a highly conserved versatile scaffold that regulates small GTPases such as Rho, Rac, and Ras. To evaluate if BNIP-2 does impact Rho signaling in cardiomyoblast, we measured the levels of active RhoA (RhoA-GTP) and phosphorylated myosin light chain in BNIP-2 knockdown and BNIP-2 overexpressed H9c2 cardiomyoblast. We observed a significant decrease in the active Rho level and phosphorylated myosin light chain in BNIP-2 knockdown cells (Figure S5A,C, Supporting Information), a direct indication of reduced intracellular contractility in the absence of BNIP-2. Conversely, overexpression of BNIP-2 increased levels of active RhoA and phosphorylated myosin light chain (Figure S5B, Supporting Information). Since RhoA is the upstream GTPase that regulates myosin II-dependent contractility, we further hypothesized that BNIP-2 might promote cellular contractility through RhoA activation, with the resultant increase in cell contractility being crucial for BNIP-2 to support YAP inactivation by LATS1 during cardiomyoblast differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we first verified whether force generation by cardiomyocytes is affected by the absence of BNIP-2. Consistently, BNIP-2 knockdown significantly reduced the average force generated on microfabricated pillars that mimic in vivo rigidity (Figure 5D,E), suggesting that BNIP-2 activation of RhoA and myosin light chain activation is required for force generation on the extracellular matrix (ECM). Next, we performed a laser ablation experiment (Figure 5F) to determine the intracellular contractility that should reflect the acti-\n\nFigure 4.

Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH vation of RhoA by BNIP-2. Indeed, the knocking down of BNIP-2 reduced the recoil velocity of actin filaments. Conversely, overexpression of BNIP-2 increases the recoil velocity by nearly ten-folds (Figure 5G). Hence, BNIP-2 is required to generate intracellular force and exert traction force on the ECM. With BNIP-2 knockdown reducing LATS and YAP interaction and that BNIP-2 activates Rho and cellular contractility, we went on to confirm that BNIP-2 activation of Rho-dependent cellular contractility indeed is crucial for YAP inactivation. We compared the levels of YAP phosphorylation at S127 in control cells with those under BNIP-2 knockdown, rescued with BNIP-2 overexpression, or rescued with BNIP-2 overexpression but in the presence of blebbistatin. Our results showed that reduced YAP phosphorylation in BNIP-2 knockdown cells was restored by BNIP-2 overexpression. Importantly, blebbistatin treatment effectively blocked the rescue effects by BNIP-2 overexpression (Figure S5E, Supporting Information). Taken together, RhoA-mediated YAP inhibition requires cellular contractility in HEK293T, just as in H9c2, further highlighting BNIP-2/Rho/YAP axis as an important common regulatory mechanism.\n\nAt this juncture, we have delineated the multifaceted roles of BNIP-2 to i) promote cardiomyoblast differentiation through YAP inactivation and cardiac gene expression, and ii) to regulate the intracellular contractility for LATS1 and YAP interaction. Next, we sought to functionally determine whether BNIP-2 regulation of contractility could directly inactivate YAP by altering YAP intracellular localization. To do so, RhoA activity was pharmacologically modulated using Rho Activator II or RhoA inhibitor C3 toxin (Figure S5C, Supporting Information) and assayed for YAP localization. Consistent with our findings that LATS1 and YAP interaction requires force (Figure 5B,C), and our hypothesis that force regulates YAP intracellular localization in H9c2 cardiomyoblast, a significantly reduced YAP nuclear signal in H9c2 cells was observed upon RhoA activation. In contrast, increased YAP nuclear localization was observed upon the attenuation of cellular contractility by RhoA inhibition (Figure 5H). Finally, we examined how modulating RhoA activity could impact cardiac gene induction. We observed that the treatment with Rho inhibitor reduced the expression of cTnT and Myl2 in ATRA-treated H9c2 cells (Figure 5I). Strikingly, the introduction of Rho activator could partially rescue the expression of cTnT and Myl2 (Figure 5I). In addition, YAP phosphorylation could also be partially restored by Rho activator in BNIP-2 knockdown cells (Figure 5I). Collectively, these data show that BNIP-2 activation of force (i.e., cellular contractility) through RhoA helps scaffold LATS1 and YAP and promotes YAP cytoplasmic localization during differentiation and cardiac gene induction.

Please refer to main text\nfor more details.\n\nIn summary, YAP inactivation through site-specific phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention is required for hESC-CM and\nH9c2 cardiomyoblast differentiation. Mechanistically, this YAP\ninactivation process requires the scaffold protein, BNIP-2, to directly interact with and promote LATS1 and YAP interaction,\nwhich is also dependent on the contractility exerted by BNIP-2-\ninduced Rho signaling. Importantly, BNIP-2 plays a multifaceted\nrole in integrating mechanical signaling through RhoA-induced\ncontractility with the canonical LATS-YAP pathway to actuate the\ndifferentiation process. Figure 6 illustrates our proposed mechanism for BNIP-2 involvement in H9c2 differentiation and the\nsignificance is discussed below.\n\n# Discussion\n\nUsing a combinatorial approach of biochemical, biophysical, genetic and imaging analyses, we have delineated two distinct but\nconcerted mechanisms of H9c2 cardiomyoblast differentiation mediated by BNIP-2: i) BNIP-2 generates cellular contractility\nby promoting RhoA activity; and ii) BNIP-2 activation of cellular contractility, in turn, allows BNIP-2 to promote scaffolding of\nLATS1 with YAP, leading to YAP inactivation and retention in the cytoplasm, thus switching cardiomyoblast genetic programming\nfrom proliferation to sustained cardiac gene expression for differentiation (please refer to the model in Figure 6).\n\nRecent findings that YAP activity can be modulated Hippo-dependent and Hippo-independent events underscore the complexity of the YAP regulatory networks, which adaptively operate under different physiological and pathophysiological processes. Accumulating evidence have supported a more nuanced view that biochemical or mechanical regulation of YAP through LATS1 phosphorylation alone may be insufficient to induce YAP activation/inactivation. Rather, multiple biochemical or mechanical pathways seem to exist, which must reach a threshold for YAP activation/inactivation. For instance, despite normal LATS1 activity and YAP S127 phosphorylation, 𝛼E-catenin depletion has been reported to result in higher nuclear YAP in hair follicle stem cells, implying that LATS1-dependent biochemical signal can be bypassed. On the other hand, in genetically modified talin1-null fibroblast that initially lacks nuclear YAP, ECM-nuclear mechanical coupling was shown to promote YAP nuclear translocation independent of biochemical signaling axes. Importantly, while these studies likely represented the extrema in how YAP signaling network can be tuned (i.e., by using mechanobiological perturbation to override biochemical signaling), in many physiological contexts, it is likely that an intricate balancing act between biochemical and mechanobiological cues is at play. This would then implicate the existence of a context-dependent key molecular regulator that can integrate biochemical (Hippo-dependent) and mechanical (Hippo- independent) inputs to regulate YAP activity through YAP intracellular localization. Our findings in H9c2 cardiomyoblast report a central and multifaceted role of a molecular scaffold, BNIP-2, that concurrently activates the biochemical and\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com www.advancedscience.com\n\nmechanical axes to activate intracellular contractility through RhoA activation and inactivate YAP by directly scaffolding LATS1 to YAP. These findings are highly relevant to in vivo cardiac development as it has previously been shown that nuclear YAP activation in mouse fetal heart not only promotes proliferation but induces the expression of various genes that controls cytoskeletal dynamics.\n\nIn addition, it has been previously suggested that LATS1/2 kinase activity can be activated by GPCR activation through an unknown Rho GTPase activation and altered F-actin dynamics through a yet elusive mechanism. Our findings now show that BNIP-2 is likely the missing trigger for RhoA activation as well as enhanced LATS1 activity which inactivates YAP during cardiomyoblast differentiation. Furthermore, since proper heart formation requires distinct steps of cardiomyocyte proliferation followed by terminal differentiation, our identification of BNIP-2 as a molecular regulator that integrates mechanical and biochemical regulation of YAP raise an intriguing possibility that BNIP-2 could function as the in vivo switch between proliferation and terminal differentiation.\n\nThe role of scaffold proteins in regulating cell growth, apoptosis, morphogenesis, migration, and differentiation poses an interesting conundrum. As shown in various cellular systems, scaffold proteins enable complex signal processing that may be important for spatiotemporal localization and amplification of signals. One such example is the scaffolding effects of another BCH domain-containing protein, BPGAP1, that spatially integrates JNK/ERK signaling. Interestingly, BPGAP1 is autoinhibitory and requires phosphorylation by JNK for its activation to promote MEK partner 1-induced ERK activation. Hence, there may exist beyond biochemical regulation other forms of regulatory elements to facilitate scaffolding proteins to generate transient, sustained, and even oscillatory signals at the right place and at the right time. Given the prominent roles of mechanical stimuli in influencing key cellular functions (e.g., proliferation and differentiation) it can be postulated that cell-ECM or cell-cell interactions may help provide mechanical cues that influences scaffolding proteins functions. Indeed, previous studies revealed that BNIP-2 can localize to either cell protrusions or microtubules and that YAP can localize to the cytoplasm, the nucleus or the adherens junctions. Our study revealed that BNIP-2 colocalizes with LATS1 and the cellular protrusions during cardiomyoblast differentiation. These observations suggest that after the establishment of clear cardiomyocyte-specific sarcomeric and microtubular structures, BNIP-2 could be relocalized from the initial cellular protrusions to the microtubule.\n\nIntriguingly, an increased BNIP-2 expression correlated with the emergence of cardiac gene markers (cTnT and Myl2). Could BNIP-2 be expressed prior to cardiac genes? Or are they concurrently expressed under similar transcriptional regulations? We postulate the latter based on the transcription factor binding prediction for the presence of promoter sequences upstream of the first exon of BNIP-2, which responds to the transcription factor FOXP3. Interestingly, various studies have shown that ATRA (which is also required for cardiac development) induces the expression of FOXP3. These observations implicate that more organ systems (e.g., immune, eye, hindbrain, spinal cord, lung, pancreas, and skeleton) that require ATRA during development may be regulated by BNIP-2. Some of these possibilities are now being investigated.\n\nWork is currently underway to elucidate how RhoA is activated in situ by BNIP-2 and how force/contractility can regulate the BNIP-2/LATS1/YAP complex. The activation of GEFs and/or inactivation of RhoGAP through its BCH domain is one possible mechanism. We have recently shown that BNIP-2 in epithelial cells activate RhoA by scaffolding RhoGEF GEH-H1 upon microtubule depolymerization whereas its homologous BCH domain in p50RhoGAP can control how its adjacent RhoGAP domain functions toward Rho.\n\nIt is currently unknown which RhoGEF or RhoGAP may be involved in the process of BNIP-2-dependent cardiomyoblast differentiation. Moreover, it remains an interesting prospect to dissect how cells can sense and generate the contractile force through BNIP-2 and RhoA, and then transduce such mechanical signals into promoting its biochemical scaffolding function that enables LATS to phosphorylate YAP in the cytoplasm. It is likely that such mechanical force-dependent process may activate directly or indirectly biochemical activities in one (or more) of the constituents of the BNIP-2/Rho/Hippo/YAP complex. One interesting possibility could be that LATS1, which was found to bind to actin and favors actin depolymerization could have “disengaged” from RhoA-induced F-actin structures. Such disengagement could have led to the colocalization of BNIP-2 and LATS1 at cell protrusions observed in our study, paving the way toward our better understanding of mechanical force in regulating the spatiotemporal modes of biochemical signaling and functions.\n\nOn the other hand, previous studies have observed RhoA regulation of YAP activation instead of its inactivation and that effect appears to be less dependent on force. For instance, various human disease models (e.g., diffuse gastric cancer, glioblastoma tumorigenicity, abnormal human trabecular meshwork) implicate the activation of YAP that is dependent on RhoA activation. Most of these systems focus on the proliferative effects induced by YAP, which is aligned with the known functions of YAP. Our study, therefore, offers fresh insights into the coupling of force and biochemical interactions during the induction of cardiac genes. To this end, we are investigating how BNIP-2 could regulate focal adhesion complex, which is also known to be regulated by RhoA and linked to YAP activities.\n\nFinally, understanding how the switch from growth to differentiation regimes could be achieved through BNIP-2-mediated regulation of the Rho and Hippo-YAP signaling pathways should help advance further research into potential targets to improve and restore lost functions of heart cells and tissues, and to prevent their malfunctions from developing into heart diseases. Furthermore, since H9c2 cells also show high similarities to primary neonate cardiomyocytes (e.g., hypertrophic responses, hypoxia-reoxygenation injury, response to RA-induced differentiation), more detailed mechanistic understanding of key signaling nodes at the molecular levels can help translate our findings for future in vivo studies and translational applications.\n\n# Experimental Section\n\nCell Culture and Transfection: All cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO 2.

Optimized guides were selected using a web browser for selection of sgRNA candidates (http://crispor.tefor.net/) as previously described[65] and using the “Rule set 2” scoring model in prioritizing top sgRNA candidates.[66] Annealed sgRNA constructs at a final concentration of 0.4 × 10−6 m were cloned into 500 ng of Esp3I-digested LentiCRISPRv2 backbone (Addgene #52961) using T4 DNA ligase (catalogue no.

BNIP-2 protein was in vitro translated using 250 ng of Pxj40-HA-BNIP-2 plasmid and the PURExpress In Vitro Protein Synthesis Kit (NEB # E6800S) following the manufacturer’s protocol. LATS1 and YAP were endogenously immunoprecipitated, respectively, using PureProteome Protein A/G Magnetic Bead System (LSKMAGA10). 80% confluent HEK293T cells were lysed with the mild lysis buffer, M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher #78501) supplemented with protease inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate and beta glycerophosphate. Respective cell lysates were incubated with LATS1(CST #3477S) and YAP (CST #4912) antibodies overnight in a cold room. PureProteome Protein A/G Magnetic Bead System (LSKMAGA10) was added to the cell lysates and incubated for an hour in the cold room. 0.1 m Glycine pH 2.0 and pH 8.0 were added sequentially to elute the beads-bound YAP protein. The kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 30 min, by mixing the beads-bound LATS1, eluted YAP and in vitro translated BNIP-2 with 1× kinase buffer (CST #9802) and 500 cold ATP (NEB # P0756S). 4× SDS sample buffer was added to stop the reaction, and samples were heated at 85 °C for 10 min.\n\n# Immunofluorescence Staining:\n\nFor fluorescence staining of cells, cells were fixed with warm (37 °C) 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 37 °C for 15 min. For super-resolution imaging, an additional quenching step using freshly prepared 0.01% sodium borohydride was used to quench the fixation. After fixation, cells were washed thrice with 1× PBS and left on a shaker for a further 5 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. After permeabilizing with blocking buffer, cells were incubated with respective primary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature. Thereafter, cells were washed thrice with 1× PBS.

Cells transfected only with renilla plasmid were used as a negative control. Briefly, cells were seeded to 80% confluency and transfected with luciferase and renilla plasmid in a 10:1 ratio to assay for YAP activity and prevent over saturation of renilla signal. The Promega Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (#E1910) was used to quantify luciferase and renilla signal following the manufacturer's protocol. The Promega Glomax Discover plate reader was used to read and record the luciferase signal.\n\n# Confocal and Structured Illumination Microscopy:\n\nConfocal imaging was performed using Yokogawa CSU-W1 Spinning Disk microscope equipped with a 60× (NA 1.20) water immersion lens or 100× (NA 1.45) oil immersion objective lens. Super-resolution imaging was performed using Nikon Structured Illumination Microscope (N-SIM) equipped with a 100× oil immersion lens taking 15 images (3 directions × 5 phases) for one frame of reconstructed images. SIM reconstruction was performed using NIS-Elements AR.\n\n# Laser Ablation:\n\nThirty minutes prior to imaging, H9c2 cells were stained with CellMask Actin Tracking Stain. To measure recoil velocity due to tensional release of actin filaments within the cells, distinctive features were monitored before, during and after UV laser ablation. Spatiotemporal information of the distinctive features after UV ablation was obtained and quantified using MTrackJ plugin in Fiji imageJ. Fitting of calculated distance between points of distinctive features was carried out using a linear function and a single exponential function. The single exponential function was used for datasets with fast recoil velocity to obtain fast elastic response of the actin network mesh upon ablation.\n\n# Bio-ID Proximity Labeling:\n\nHuman BNIP-2 was PCR subcloned into the NheI site, in between the 3HA tag and TurboID, of 3XHA-TurboID-NLS_pCDNA3 using specific primers. The NLS of the 3XHA-TurboID-NLS_pCDNA3 and 3XHA-BNIP-2-TurboID-NLS_pCDNA3 were removed by site-directed mutagenesis PCR. Enrichment of biotin-labeled proteins was achieved using streptavidin magnetic beads, and subjected to SDS-PAGE for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The interactome of BNIP-2 was determined after subtraction of the background provided by the 3XHA-TurboID_pCDNA3.\n\n# RNA Sequencing:\n\nTotal RNA was harvested from samples using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA was sent to BGI Genomics Co., Ltd. for RNA sequencing in Shenzhen, China. Samples were sequenced using BGISEQ-500 paired-end platform, generating about 26.18 M reads per sample on average. The sequencing reads which contained low-quality, adaptor-polluted and high content of unknown base (N) reads, were removed before downstream analyses.\nImage Analysis:\n\nAll image processing was performed using either ImageJ software or MATLAB custom-written script. For focal adhesion size and number quantification, cell edges were identified by analyzing the DIC images, each focal adhesion was identified by analyzing the RFP channel images (focal adhesion staining) via adjusting threshold according to the current images, and by applying ImageJ analysis “Analyse Particles.” The number of focal adhesions per cell was calculated from the number of ROI identified from “Analyse Particles.” For YAP nuclear versus cytoplasmic ratio quantification, signal intensity in the nucleus and a region just outside the nucleus was quantified. For cell alignment quantification, ImageJ plugin “Directionality” was used to calculate dispersion, and a MATLAB custom script was used to generate the rose plot.\n\nStatistical Analysis:\n\nData comparisons throughout the manuscript are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and plotted using GraphPad Prism 8. All data sets were analyzed using two-tailed Student’s t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with GraphPad Prism 8. In cases whereby, samples do not meet normality criteria, a nonparametric test was used. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant (* indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01, *** indicates p < 0.001, and **** indicates p < 0.0001). All experiments involving statistical comparison were performed at least three times.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the Mechanobiology Institute Singapore (MBI), funded through the National Research Foundation and the Ministry of Education Singapore to B.C.L and P.K. and also by the Ministry of Education (Singapore) Academic Research Fund Tier 3 (MOE Grant No. MOE2016-T3-1-002) to B.C.L. with Research Scholarship to D.C.P.W., and by the Ministry of Education (Singapore) Academic Research Fund Tier2 (MOE2019-T2-2-014) to P.K.

However, the toxic mechanism of Mad in cardiac muscle cells is not well understood. Here, we show that Mad induced cell viability reduction and apoptosis in cardiac-derived H9c2, HL-1 cells, primary cardiomyocytes and murine cardiac muscles, which was due to inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2). Expression of constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MKK1) attenuated Mad-induced cell death in H9c2 cells, whereas silencing Erk1/2 or ectopic expression of dominant negative MKK1 strengthened Mad-induced cell death. Moreover, we found that both phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and Akt were implicated in the regulation of Erk1/2 inactivation and apoptosis in the cells and tissues exposed to Mad. Overexpression of dominant negative PTEN and/or constitutively active Akt, or constitutively active Akt and/or constitutively active MKK1 rescued the cells from Mad-induced dephosphorylated-Erk1/2 and cell death. Furthermore, Mad-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) activated PTEN and inactivated Akt-Erk1/2 contributing to cell death, as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) ameliorated the event. Taken together, the results disclose that Mad inhibits Erk1/2 via ROS-dependent activation of PTEN and inactivation of Akt, leading to cell death in cardiac muscle cells. Our findings suggest that manipulation of ROS-PTEN-Akt-Erk1/2 pathway may be a potential approach to prevent Mad-induced cardiotoxicity.\n\n*Address correspondence to: Long Chen, Ph.D. (College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, 1 Wenyuan Road, Chixia District, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, P.

Many reports have documented that Mad is toxic to animals and humans if improperly used (Bastianello et al., 1995; Dorne et al., 2013; Fourie et al., 1991; Jayashree and Singhi, 2011; Shimshoni et al., 2014). Clinical data have shown that Mad evokes anorexia, diarrhea, dyspnea, depression, ataxia, recumbency and death, and especially Mad results in degeneration and/or necrosis of heart and skeletal muscles (Bastianello et al., 1995; Dorne et al., 2013; Fourie et al., 1991; Jayashree and Singhi, 2011; Shimshoni et al., 2014). For example, Mad induces severe myocardial lesions in chickens, pigs, gilts, calves (Bastianello et al., 1995; Dorne et al., 2013; Fourie et al., 1991; Sanford and McNaughton, 1991; Shimshoni et al., 2014; Shlosberg et al., 1992; Shlosberg et al., 1997; Singh and Gupta, 2003). Importantly, increasing cases of poisoning with Mad by accident have been reported in humans especially in children, leading to rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and even death (Jayashree and Singhi, 2011; Sharma et al., 2005). Recently, we have demonstrated that Mad inhibits proliferation by arresting cells at G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in C2C12 myoblast cells (Chen et al., 2014b). However, how Mad induces apoptotic cell death in cardiac muscle cells is not well understood.\n\nExtracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), a member of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell proliferation/growth and apoptosis (Kyriakis and Avruch, 2012; Xia et al., 2016). For example, Erk1/2 is involved in the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells and neonatal cardiomyocytes (Liu et al., 2008). Sialyltransferase 7A promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis through inhibition of Erk1/2 activity under hypoxic conditions (Zhang et al., 2015). Erk2 knockdown enhances caspase 3 activity in H2O2-stimulated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (Ulm et al., 2014). Besides, it has been reported that monensin, another polyether ionophore antibiotic, increases Erk1/2 activity in NCI-H929 myeloma cells (Park et al., 2003). This prompted us to focus on studying whether Mad affects Erk1/2 activity leading to apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells.\n\nPhosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a dual phosphatase which dephosphorylates proteins and phosphoinositides substrates, is an important negative regulator of Akt (Bermudez Brito et al., 2015; Maehama and Dixon, 1999; Panigrahi et al., 2004). Interestingly, recent studies have shown that PTEN also negatively regulates Erk1/2 pathway in several malignancies (Chetram and Hinton, 2012). Additionally, Akt is able to activate Erk1/2 through protein kinase C (PKC) (Chetram and Hinton, 2012). Of note, multiple studies have documented that excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis links to dysfunction of PTEN, Akt and/or Erk1/2 signaling (Kim et al., 2014; Lv et al., 2014; Matsuno et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2016; Yao et al.,\n\nJ Cell Physiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 July 01.\n# Chen et al.\n\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n2012). For example, H2O2 induces injury in cardiac myocytes via inhibiting PTEN protein expression (Lv et al., 2014). Doxorubicin induces injury through PTEN/Akt and Erk pathway in H9c2 cells (Yao et al., 2016). Salinomycin, another polyether ionophore, induces intracellular ROS overproduction (Verdoodt et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2013). Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that Mad may affect Erk1/2 pathway via ROS-mediated PTEN-Akt signaling pathway, thereby leading to cardiac apoptosis.\n\nHere, for the first time, we show that Mad-induced ROS activates PTEN and inactivates Akt-Erk1/2, leading to apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells. Our findings underline that intervention in ROS-PTEN-Akt-Erk1/2 signaling pathway may be a potential approach to prevent Mad-induced cardiotoxicity.\n\nAuthor ManuscriptReagents2.

Cell culture\n\nRat cardiac myoblast H9c2 cells (CRL-1446, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 4.5 mg/ml high glucose, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine. Murine cardiomyocytes HL-1 cells, a gift from William Claycomb (Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA, USA), were grown in Claycomb medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μM norepinephrine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine (Sun et al., 2017).

The resulting mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 100 g, and the pelleted cells were then resuspended in DMEM/F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% FBS. As nonmyocytes attach to the substrata more rapidly, to exclude nonmyocytes, the isolated cells were first seeded in 100-mm culture dishes. Following 2 h culture in a humid incubator (37°C, 5% CO2), the non-attached cells were collected. Finally, the isolated cells were seeded at a 96-well plate (1 × 104 cells/well) or a 6-well plate (2 × 106 cells/well), supplemented with 100 μM BrdU during the first 48 h to prevent proliferation of nonmyocytes.\n\n# 2.3. Animals and administration with Mad\n\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nThirty male ICR mice, weighing 18–22 g, were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center, Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China). All animals were handled in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and were in compliance with the guidelines set forth by the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The mice were housed at room temperature (20–25°C), relative humidity of 60%, subjected to a 12 h-light/dark cycle under conventional barrier protection, and supplied with water and feed ad libitum. After acclimatization to these conditions for 1 week, the mice were randomly divided into normal control group and Mad treatment group (15 mice/group). A subacute Mad regimen (3.5 mg/kg), according to 1/10 LD50, was used. The mice in the Mad treatment group were intragastrically administered with Mad solution, which was dissolved in 2 ml of 100% ethanol and then diluted 10-fold with distilled water to obtain a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, and the control group received intragastric administration of water/vehicle daily for 7 d. At the end of the experiment, all animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and heart tissues (retaining the ventricles only) were immediately removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde or stored at −80°C for further analysis.\n\n# 2.4.

Recombinant adenovirus expressing HA-tagged constitutively active Akt (Ad-myr-Akt) was generously provided by Dr. Kenneth Walsh (Boston University, Boston, MA) (Fujio and Walsh, 1999). For experiments, cells were grown in the growth medium and infected with the individual adenovirus for 24 h at 5 of multiplicity of infection (MOI=5). Subsequently, cells were used for experiments. Ad-GFP served as a control. Expression of FLAG-tagged MKK1-R4F and MKK1-K97M, and HA-tagged myr-Akt was determined by Western blot analysis with antibodies to FLAG and HA, respectively.\n\n# 2.5.

Next day, cells were treated with 0–1 μM Mad or with/without 0.5 and 1 μM Mad for 48 h, or treated with/without 0.5 and/or 1 μM Mad for 48 h following pre-incubation with/without 5 mM NAC for 1 h with 6 replicates of each treatment. Subsequently, cell viability, after incubation with MTS reagent (one solution reagent) (20 μl/well) for 3 h, was evaluated by measuring the optical density (OD) at 490 nm using a Victor X3 Light Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).\n\nAuthor Manuscript\n\n# 2.7. Flow cytometry of apoptotic cells and cell caspase-3/7 activity\n\nH9c2 cells, HL-1 cells and primary cardiomyocytes were seeded in a 100-mm dish (5 × 105 cells/dish) or 96-well plate (1 × 104 cells/well), respectively. The next day, cells were treated with 0–1 μM Mad for 48 h or 24 h, with 6 replicates of each treatment. Subsequently, apoptotic cells were monitored by annexin V-FITC/PI staining and analyzed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) Vantage SE flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, California, USA). Caspase-3/7 activity was determined using Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), following the instructions of the supplier.\n\n# DAPI and TUNEL staining\n\nH9c2 cells, HL-1 cells and primary cardiomyocytes, or H9c2 cells infected with Ad-MKK1-R4F, Ad-MKK1-K97M, Ad-PTEN-C/S, Ad-myr-Akt, Ad-PTEN-C/S/Ad-myr-Akt, Ad-myr-Akt/Ad-MKK1-R4F or Ad-GFP, or H9c2 cells infected with lentiviral shRNAs to Erk1/2 or GFP, respectively, were seeded in a 6-well plate (5 × 105 cells/well). Next day, cells were treated with 0–1 μM Mad or with/without 0.5 and 1 μM Mad for 48 h, or treated with/without 0.5 and/or 1 μM Mad for 48 h following pre-incubation with/without 5 mM NAC for 1 h with 6 replicates of each treatment. Subsequently, the cells with fragmented and condensed nuclei were determined using DAPI staining as described (Chen et al., 2008). For the cells pretreated with/without 0–1 μM of Mad for 48 h, following DAPI staining, TUNEL staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols of In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit® (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). For cardiac muscle of Mad-exposed mice, paraffin-embedded cardiac tissue sections were prepared, followed by TUNEL staining, as described (Chen et al., 2014a). Finally, photographs were taken under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMi8, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a digital camera. For quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity using TUNEL staining, the integral optical density (IOD) was measured by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics Inc., Newburyport, MA, USA).\n\nJ Cell Physiol.

The next day, following treatment with Mad (0–1 μM) for 24 h, the cells on the coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with 3% normal goat serum to block non-specific binding. For cardiac muscle of Mad-exposed mice, paraffin sections were dewaxed using xylene and dehydrated, followed by antigen retrieval, washing with PBS, and sealing in 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA), as described (Xu et al., 2014). Next, the cells and tissue sections were incubated with mouse anti-phospho-Erk1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:50, diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA) overnight at 4°C, washed three times (5 min per time) with PBS, followed by incubating with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500, diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells and tissue sections were then washed three times (5 min per time) with PBS. Finally, the slides for the cells and tissue sections were mounted in glycerol/PBS (1:1, v/v) containing 2.5% 1,4-diazabiclo-(2,2,2)octane. Cell images were captured under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMi8, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a digital camera. IOD for fluorescence intensity was quantitatively analyzed by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software as described above.\n\n# 2.10. ROS detection\n\nDetecting intracellular ROS were performed using an oxidant-sensitive probe, CM-H2DCFDA, as described previously (Zhang et al., 2017). H9c2 cells, HL-1 cells and primary cardiomyocytes were seeded in a 96-well plate (1 × 104 cells/well). Next day, cells were treated with 0–1 μM Mad or treated with/without 0.5 and/or 1 μM Mad for 24 h following pre-incubation with/without 5 mM NAC for 1 h with 6 replicates of each treatment. Subsequently, cells were loaded with 10 μM CM-H2DCFDA for 40 min. Fluorescent intensity was recorded by excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm using a Victor X3 Light Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).\n\nFor heart tissues, the ventricle homogenates were diluted 1:20 (vol/vol) with ice-cold Locke’s buffer (154 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 3.6 mM NaHCO3, 2.0 mM CaCl2, 10 mM D-glucose, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to obtain a concentration of 10 mg tissue/ml. The reaction mixture (1 ml) containing Locke’s buffer (pH 7.4), 0.2 ml homogenates and 10 μl of CM-H2DCFDA (10 μM) was incubated for 15 min at room temperature to allow the CM-H2DCFDA to be incorporated into any membrane-bound vesicles and the diacetate group to be cleaved by esterases. After further incubation for 30 min, the fluorescent intensity for the conversion of CM-H2DCFDA to fluorescent product DCF was recorded. Above ROS formation was quantified from a DCF-standard curve and data were expressed as pM DCF formed/min/mg protein.\n\n# 2.11. Western blot analysis\n\nWestern blotting was performed, as described previously (Chen et al., 2014b). Heart tissues were homogenized in 3 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer. For in vitro H9c2 cells, HL-1 cells and primary cardiomyocytes, after treatment, cells were briefly washed with cold PBS, and then on ice, lysed in RIPA buffer. Homogenates or lysates were sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged\n\nJ Cell Physiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 July 01.\n# Author Manuscript\n\nat 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. After that, the supernatants or lysates containing equivalent amounts of protein were separated on 7–12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Membranes were incubated with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk to block nonspecific binding, and then with primary antibodies against phospho-Akt (p-Akt) (Thr308), p-Akt (Ser473), cleaved-caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), p-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), Erk2, Akt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p-PTEN (Thr366), PTEN (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA), MKK1, FLAG, HA (Sigma) overnight at 4°C, respectively, followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies including horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG, or rabbit anti-goat IgG (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) overnight at 4°C. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (Millipore).\n\n# Statistical analysis\n\nResults were expressed as mean values ± standard error (SE). Statistically significant differences between treatment means were identified by using the Student’s t-test for non-paired replicates. One-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post-tests to compare replicate means was conducted to compare group variability and interaction. A level of P < 0.05 was considered to be significant.\n\n# Results\n\n# Mad induces apoptotic cell death in cardiac muscle cells\n\nOur previous study has shown that exposure of Mad to C2C12 skeletal muscle cells results in cell viability reduction, and identified that Mad induces apoptosis in the myoblasts (Chen et al., 2014b). In line with the above findings, here we also observed that treatment with Mad (0–1 μM) for 48 h resulted in cell viability reduction in cardiac muscle cells (H9c2, HL-1 cells and primary cardiomyocytes) in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1a). To elucidate Mad-induced cardiac apoptosis, annexin-V-FITC/PI staining was used. The results showed that Mad increased the relative number of apoptotic H9c2, HL-1 cells and primary cardiomyocytes dose-dependently (Figure 1b and c). Mad at 1 μM elicited apoptotic cell proportion by 34.33%, 26.89% and 42.87% compared to control group in H9c2, HL-1 cells and primary cardiomyocytes (Figure 1b and c), respectively. In addition, we further tested the cells with nuclear fragmentation and condensation, a hallmark of apoptosis (Hao et al., 2013), using DAPI staining, and concurrently analyzed DNA strand breaks in the cells by TUNEL staining (Figure 1d–f). Imaged and quantified results exhibited that the percentage of the cells with nuclear fragmentation and condensation (arrows) and the number of TUNEL-positive cells with fragmented DNA (in green) increased significantly in H9c2, HL-1 cells and primary cardiomyocytes induced by 48-h exposure to Mad, compared with the control (Figure 1d–f). Similar results were also observed in the cardiac muscle of Mad-exposed mice (3.5 mg/kg) by intragastric administration for 7 days (Figure 1g and h). Collectively, the findings indicate that Mad induces apoptotic cell death in cardiac muscle cells.\n\nJ Cell Physiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 July 01.\n# Chen et al. - Page 8\n\nAuthor ManuscriptMad inhibits Erk1/2 pathway contributing to apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells3.2.\n\nIt has been reported that Erk1/2 was involved in the regulation of cell apoptosis (Kyriakis and Avruch, 2012; Xia et al., 2016). Our Western blot analysis also showed that Mad dose-dependently evoked robust cleavages of caspase-3 and PARP in H9c2, HL-1 cells and primary cardiomyocytes (Figure 2a). Interestingly, we found that Mad reduced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) (Figure 2a), indicating that Mad triggers inactivation of Erk1/2, which may mediate apoptotic cell death. To confirm this, we further conducted p-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) immunofluorescence staining and caspase3/7 activity assay in the cells, respectively. The results revealed that treatment with Mad (0.05–1 μM) for 24 h resulted in an obvious decline in phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) (in green) (Figure 2b and c). In line with the Mad-increased cleaved-caspase-3, Mad profoundly induced activation of caspases 3/7 in the cells (Figure 2d). Moreover, the events were also observed in murine cardiac muscles exposed to Mad (Figure 2e–g). These data demonstrate that Mad induced inactivation of Erk1/2 and apoptotic cell death in cardiac muscle cells.\n\nTo verify the role of Erk1/2 inactivation in Mad-induced apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells, Erk1/2 was silenced by RNA interference. As detected by Western blotting, lentiviral shRNA to Erk1/2, but not to GFP, downregulated expression of Erk1/2 by ~ 90% in H9c2 cells (Figure 3a). Silencing Erk1/2 strengthened Mad-induced dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 and cleavage of caspase-3 (Figure 3b). Consistently, downregulation of Erk1/2 enhanced cell viability reduction and apoptosis in H9c2 cells in response to Mad (Figure 3c and d). Further, we extended our studies by modifying MKK1 (an upstream kinase of Erk1/2) activity. To this end, H9c2 cells, infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing FLAG-tagged constitutively active MKK1 (Ad-MKK1-R4F), dominant negative MKK1 (Ad-MKK1-K97M) and control virus encoding GFP alone (Ad-GFP), respectively, were exposed to Mad (0.5 and 1 μM) for 24 h or 48 h. As expected, expression of high levels of FLAG-tagged MKK1 mutants was seen in Ad-MKK1-R4F- or Ad-MKK1-K97M-infected cells, but not in Ad-GFP-infected cells (control) (Figure 3e). Expression of MKK1-R4F led to robust phosphorylation of Erk1/2 even with exposure to Mad, whereas expression of MKK1-K97M almost completely abolished the basal or Mad-inhibited phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (Figure 3e), indicating that the MKK1 mutants function in the cells. Of note, expression of MKK1-R4F in H9c2 cells conferred profound resistance to Mad-induced cleaved-caspase-3, cell viability reduction and apoptosis (Figure 3e–g). In contrast, expression of MKK1-K97M in the cells dramatically reinforced the events triggered by Mad (Figure 3e–g). The results clearly indicate that Mad inhibits Erk1/2 pathway leading to apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells.\n\nAuthor ManuscriptMad induces Erk1/2 inhibition and apoptosis in part by activating PTEN and3.3. inactivating Akt in cardiac muscle cells\n\nIt is well-known that PTEN, Akt and Erk1/2 interact with each other and regulate cell proliferation/growth and death in a series of cells (Bermudez Brito et al., 2015; Chetram and Hinton, 2012; Xu et al., 2015). The current study has found that Mad induces inactivation of Erk1/2 pathway (Figure 2 and 3). Therefore, we reasoned that PTEN and/or Akt signaling may be involved in Mad-induced inactivation of Erk1/2, leading to apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells. Firstly, we checked the phosphorylation status of PTEN and Akt in the cells\n\nJ Cell Physiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 July 01.\n# Chen et al.\n\nAuthor Manuscript and murine cardiac muscles exposed to Mad. The results showed that Mad inhibited the phosphorylation of PTEN (Thr366) and Akt (Thr308 and Ser473) in H9c2, HL-1 cells, primary cardiomyocytes dose-dependently (Figure 4a). Similar results were observed in murine cardiac muscles (Figure 4b), implying that Mad activates PTEN and inactivates Akt in cardiac muscle cells. Next, H9c2 cells, infected with Ad-PTEN-C/S, Ad-PTEN-C/S/Ad-myr-Akt and Ad-GFP (as control), respectively, were exposed to Mad (0.5 and 1 μM) for 24 or 48 h. Infection with Ad-PTEN-C/S and Ad-myr-Akt, but not Ad-GFP, evoked expression of high levels of p-PTEN and HA-tagged Akt mutant in the cells (Figure 4c).\n\nOverexpression of PTEN-C/S in H9c2 cells rendered remarkable resistance to Mad-induced dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 and cleavage of caspase-3 (Figure 4c), as well as cell viability reduction and apoptosis (Figure 4d and e). Of importance, Mad-induced events were more potently ameliorated in Ad-PTEN-C/S/Ad-myr-Akt-infected cells than in Ad-PTEN-C/S- or Ad-GFP-infected cells (Figure 4c–e). Collectively, the findings support the notion that Mad induces suppression of Erk1/2 and consequential cell apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells, in part, by activation of PTEN and inactivation of Akt.\n\nTo further uncover the role of Akt in Mad-induced Erk1/2 inactivation and apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells, H9c2 cells infected with Ad-myr-Akt and/or Ad-MKK1-R4F were utilized. As shown in Figure 4f, expression of high levels of HA-tagged Akt and/or FLAG-tagged MKK1 mutants was seen in H9c2 cells infected with Ad-myr-Akt and/or Ad-MKK1-R4F, but not in the cells infected with Ad-GFP (control virus). Overexpression of myr-Akt remarkably prevented Mad-induced dephosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2, cleaved-caspase-3, cell viability reduction and apoptosis (Figure 4f–h). Interestingly, the cells expressing myr-Akt/MKK1-R4F possessed more powerful inhibitory effects on Mad-induced events than the cells expressing myr-Akt alone (Figure 4f–h). These data indicate that Mad elicited Erk1/2 inhibition contributing to apoptosis partly by inactivation of Akt in cardiac muscle cells.\n\n# 3.4. Mad-induced ROS results in PTEN activation and Akt-Erk1/2 inactivation, leading to apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells\n\nROS has been identified as a key player in cardiomyocyte apoptosis (Lv et al., 2014; Matsuno et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2016). To unveil whether Mad induces ROS in cardiac muscle cells, H9c2, HL-1 cells and primary cardiomyocytes were treated with Mad (0–1 μM) for 24 h, or mice were intragastrically administered with Mad (3.5 mg/kg) for 7 days, followed by ROS detection using CM-H2DCFDA. As shown in Figure 5a and b, Mad treatment significantly increased the ROS levels in the cells and cardiac muscles, which was markedly attenuated by pretreatment with NAC, an antioxidant and ROS scavenger (Figure 5c). NAC also attenuated the effects of Mad on the expression of p-PTEN, p-Akt and p-Erk1/2 in the cells (Figure 5d). Importantly, Mad-induced cleaved-caspase-3, cell viability reduction and apoptosis were substantially weakened by pretreatment with NAC (Figure 5d–f). These results clearly indicate that Mad-elevated ROS activates PTEN and inactivates Akt-Erk1/2, thereby leading to apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells.\n\nJ Cell Physiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 July 01.\n# Author Manuscript\n\n4. Discussion\n\nMad, an anticoccidial agent used in the poultry, has been reported to be toxic to the humans, and animals such as chickens, turkeys, pigs, cattle, sheep, etc. (Bastianello et al., 1995; Dorne et al., 2013; Fourie et al., 1991; Jayashree and Singhi, 2011; Shimshoni et al., 2014). Especially, emerging studies have pointed out Mad-induced severe myocardial and skeletal muscle lesions (Bastianello et al., 1995; Dorne et al., 2013; Fourie et al., 1991; Jayashree and Singhi, 2011; Shimshoni et al., 2014). Of importance, growing reports have documented the human cases of poisoning with Mad by accident (Jayashree and Singhi, 2011; Sharma et al., 2005). Our recent study has shown that Mad inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells (Chen et al., 2014b). However, little is known about the toxic mechanism of Mad in cardiac muscle cells. Here we provide evidence that Mad induced apoptotic cell death by inhibiting Erk1/2 pathway in cardiac muscle cells. Further, we found that Mad induction of intracellular ROS elicited inhibition of Erk1/2 contributing to cell apoptosis via activation of PTEN and inactivation of Akt.\n\nIn this study, we found that Mad induced dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 and cleavages of caspase-3 and PARP in H9c2, HL-1 cells, primary cardiomyocytes and murine cardiac muscle, as detected by Western blotting (Figure 2a and e). This is further supported by the results of phospho-Erk1/2 immunofluorescence staining and caspase3/7 activity assay (Figure 2b, c, d, f and g). To corroborate the above findings, genetic inhibition/silencing, or rescue experiments for Erk1/2 was carried out. We showed that silencing Erk1/2 strengthened Mad-induced dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 and cleavage of caspase-3 (Figure 3b). Concurrently, silencing Erk1/2 conferred substantial enhancement of Mad-induced apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by more reduced cell viability and elevated percentages of cells with nuclear fragmentation and condensation in H9c2 cells (Figure 3c and d). Further, we found that ectopic expression of dominant negative MKK1 (MKK-K97M) strengthened Mad-induced dephosphorylation of Erk1/2, cleaved-caspase-3 and cell apoptosis, whereas expression of constitutively active MKK1 (MKK1-R4F) attenuated these events in H9c2 cells (Figure 3e–g). Taken together, these observations support that Mad induces apoptotic cell death, at least in part, by inactivation of Erk1/2 pathway in cardiac muscle cells.\n\nIt is well-known that PTEN negatively regulates Akt signaling (Maehama and Dixon, 1999; Panigrahi et al., 2004). In this study, we observed that Mad upregulated PTEN activity and inhibited Akt, as Mad reduced the phosphorylation levels of PTEN and Akt in H9c2, HL-1 cells, primary cardiomyocytes and mice cardiac muscle (Figure 4a and b). Recent studies have suggested that PTEN also negatively regulates Erk1/2 pathway in several malignancies (Chetram and Hinton, 2012). Additionally, Akt is able to activate Erk1/2 through PKC (Chetram and Hinton, 2012). Putting all data together, we postulated that there may exist a cross-talk between PTEN, Akt and Erk1/2 pathways in cardiac muscle cells in response to Mad, i.e. Mad upregulation of PTEN and concurrent inhibition of Akt may cause inactivation of Erk1/2. Here, for the first time, we present evidence that Mad induced cardiac apoptosis indeed by upregulation of PTEN and inactivation of Akt, resulting in inhibition of Erk1/2 pathway. This is strongly supported by the findings that ectopic expression of dominant negative PTEN (PTEN-C/S) and/or myr-Akt, or myr-Akt and/or constitutively active MKK1 (MKK1-R4F) dramatically rescued the cells from Mad-induced\n\nJ Cell Physiol.

Our data underscore that Mad induces activation of PTEN and inactivation of Akt, also contributing to Erk1/2 inhibition, and eventually apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells.\n\nA new question that arises from this work is how Mad activates PTEN signaling, and thus inhibits Akt-Erk1/2 pathway, leading to apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells. Many studies have shown that ROS can alter the structures and functions of cellular proteins, and also activate or inhibit related signaling pathways, leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis (Lv et al., 2014; Matsuno et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2016). It has been reported that the polyether ionophore such as salinomycin induces intracellular ROS overproduction (Verdoodt et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2013). Excessive ROS-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis links to dysfunction of PTEN, Akt and/or Erk1/2 signaling (Kim et al., 2014; Lv et al., 2014; Matsuno et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2016; Yao et al., 2012). During our research, we also observed that when H9c2, HL-1 cells and primary cardiomyocytes were exposed to Mad (0.05–1 μM) for 24 h, or mice were intragastrically administered with Mad (3.5 mg/kg) for 7 days, cellular ROS level was significantly elevated compared to the vehicle-treated cells or murine cardiac muscles (Figure 5a and b). Pretreatment with NAC not only scavenged Mad-induced cellular ROS but also reversed Mad-elicited activation of PTEN and inactivation of Akt-Erk1/2, as well as apoptosis in the cells (Figure 5c–f). Taken together, we conclude that Mad acts by the mechanism that activates PTEN and inactivates Akt, and consequently inhibits Erk1/2 pathway leading to cardiac apoptosis through induction of ROS generation. Mad may be involved in interactions of diverse signals and expression of genes associated with cardiotoxicity. Undoubtedly, more studies are needed to address this issue.\n\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nIn summary, here we have demonstrated that Mad induction of ROS inhibits Erk1/2 leading to apoptosis through upregulation of PTEN and inactivation of Akt in cardiac muscle cells (Figure 6). The results indicate that Mad induces cardiac apoptosis, at least in part, through targeting ROS-dependent PTEN-Akt-Erk1/2 signaling network. Our findings suggest that manipulation of ROS-PTEN-Akt-Erk1/2 pathway may be a potential approach for the prevention of Mad-induced cardiotoxicity.\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the grants from National Natural Science Fundation of China (No. 30971486, 81271416; L.C.), National Institutes of Health (CA115414; S.H.), Project for the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (PAPD-14KJB180010; L.C.), and American Cancer Society (RSG-08-135-01-CNE; S.H.).\n# Chen et al.\n\n|DAPI|4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole|\n|---|---|\n|D-Hank’s|Hank’s balanced salt solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+|\n|DMEM|Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium|\n|Erk1/2|extracellular signal-regulated kinase ½|\n|F12|Ham’s F12 nutrient medium|\n|FBS|fetal bovine serum|\n|GFP|green fluorescence protein|\n|Mad|maduramicin|\n|MAPK|mitogen-activated protein kinase|\n|MKK|mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase|\n|NAC|N-acetyl-L-cysteine|\n|PARP|poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase|\n|PBS|phosphate buffered saline|\n|PKC|protein kinase C|\n|PTEN|phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome 10|\n|ROS|reactive oxygen species|\n|TUNEL|the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labeling|\n\n# References\n\nBastianello SS, Fourie N, Prozesky L, Nel PW, Kellermann TS. 1995 Cardiomyopathy of ruminants induced by the litter of poultry fed on rations containing the ionophore antibiotic, maduramicin.

While many approaches for reducing infarct size in patients have failed in the past, the advent of novel drugs that modulate cGMP and its downstream targets shows very promising results in recent preclinical and clinical studies. Here, we review main aspects of the NO–PKG pathway in light of recent drug development and summarise potential cardioprotective strategies in which cGMP is the main player.\n\nKeywords: Ischaemia/reperfusion · Cardioprotection · cGMP\n\n# Introduction\n\nSince the initial discovery that nitric oxide (NO) is the endothelial-derived relaxing factor, the last few decades have seen intensive research directed toward understanding this signal molecule and its intracellular signalling cascades. Numerous preclinical studies have shown promising results suggesting a cardioprotective role of NO signalling and revealed the NO–cGMP–PKG cascade as the responsible signalling pathway [6, 27, 28, 30, 39, 63]. Indeed numerous studies have demonstrated that disruption of this pathway leads to various pathological changes in the heart, including vascular and ventricular dysfunction, fibrosis and hypertrophy. Although not all studies are in accordance with this optimistic view on the NO–cGMP–PKG system, targeting this pathway has gained much attention, particularly from scientists keen to develop an efficient drug to treat heart failure. In this brief review, we will focus on pharmacological aspects of the cGMP–PKG pathway with updates from recent preclinical and clinical studies in relation to its direct effect on the heart. We also refer readers to excellent recent reviews providing in-depth overview of NO–cGMP–PKG pathway such as [40].\n\nThomas Krieg\n\ntk382@cam.ac.uk\n\n|1|Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapeutics, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Addenbrookes Box 110, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, UK|\n|---|---|\n|2|Bayer AG, Drug Discovery, Wuppertal, Germany|\n\n# Cardioprotective cGMP–PKG pathway\n\nNO and natriuretic peptides (NPs) are the two known classes of upstream molecules that can trigger the cGMP–PKG pathway. NO initiates the signalling pathway by activating soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of α- and β-subunits with a prosthetic heme moiety, which catalyses cGMP synthesis. On the other hand, NPs, such as ANP (atrial NP), BNP (brain NP) and CNP (C-type NP), activate particulate GC (pGC) present in the plasma membrane to produce cGMP. Both sGC and pGC generate the same second messenger cGMP, but the downstream effects of cGMP can be strikingly different depending on its subcellular localization. The elevated intracellular level of cGMP exerts its physiological actions largely by targeting cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). In mammals PKG-I is the primary kinase responsible for transducing the physiological effects in the cardiovascular system. PKG-Iα and PKG-1β have different N-termini derived from alternative splicing. It is reported that PKG-Iα is ten times more sensitive to cGMP than PKG-1β. Also, due to a unique cysteine residue (Cys 42) in PKG-Iα, it can be activated by thiol-oxidation independently of cGMP [4]. This cGMP-independent form of PKG-1α activation is able to lower\n\nVol.:(0123456789)1 3\n# Page 2 of 7\n\nBasic Research in Cardiology (2018) 113:24\n\nblood pressure through vasodilation, but its effect in cardiomyocytes is unknown.\n\nA number of studies have suggested that there are multiple downstream effectors of cGMP-PKG-I in the cardiovascular system. For example, an elevated level of cytosolic Ca2+ can result in increased cardiomyocyte inotropy but it is also known to be a lethal cause of reperfusion injury to cardiomyocytes. Several targets have been proposed as downstream PKG effectors regulating Ca2+ homeostasis in cardiomyocytes [11]. One of the proposed mechanisms is that PKG-I phosphorylates phospholamban at Ser16, which subsequently activates SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). Activated SERCA increases re-uptake of Ca2+ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and attenuates the cytosolic Ca2+ during systole [31]. Also, it was demonstrated that cGMP-mediated PKG-I activation induces opening of mitoK ATP channels residing on the inner membrane of mitochondria, and the subsequent increased K+ influx causes alkalinisation of the matrix which increases H2O2 production from complex I. The increased H2O2 activates PKC-ε and consequently protects cardiomyocytes from cell death by inhibiting the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTP) [11, 12, 47]. A more recent study showed that opening of cardiomyocyte Ca2+-activated K+ channels of the BK type (CMBK) is a critical modulator in remodelling following myocardial infarction (MI) using CMBK-knockout (KO) mice [24]. The study showed that more severe myocardial damage observed in the CMBK-deficient hearts after ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) is accompanied by a significantly increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, the study showed that pharmacological agents that elevate intracellular cGMP no longer exhibited cardioprotective effects in CMBK-KO mice. Collectively, the authors proposed the GC–cGMP–CMBK pathway as a novel therapeutic target for preventing post-MI cardiac remodelling.\n\nAlthough the precise mechanistic details how the cGMP–PKG pathway signals and interacts with downstream effectors to protect the heart remain to be characterised, a large number of preclinical studies have revealed the cardioprotective potency of the cGMP–PKG pathway by employing pharmacological tools or by manipulating relevant genes. Based on our limited understanding, the current therapeutic strategy for targeting this pathway is either by increasing cGMP biosynthesis (i.e. sGC activators or stimulators) or reducing cGMP’s catabolism (i.e. PDE inhibitors).\n\nNitric oxide\n\nNitric oxide (NO) is a key upstream molecule able to increase intracellular cGMP. NO is generated as a by-product of the enzymatic conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline by nitric oxide synthases (NOS) [60]. These include endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). All three isoforms are expressed in the cardiovascular system but have distinct subcellular localizations.\n\neNOS and nNOS are constitutively expressed and work in a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent manner, whereas iNOS is only expressed in response to inflammatory stimuli [7]. Although the cell-specific function of each isoform has not yet been fully elucidated, deletion of all three isoforms in mice resulted in the severe pathological phenotypes such as MI, spontaneous coronary artery disease and sudden cardiac death, demonstrating the cardioprotective importance of NOS in the cardiovascular system [45]. While l-arginine is the major substrate for endogenous NO production, nitrite, which can be elevated in the circulation by dietary intake, is another important source of NO [17, 51]. Nitrite can be converted non-enzymatically to NO via protonation at the low pH of the stomach [3]. Nitrite absorbed in blood and other tissues can be reduced to NO by xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) or by a nitrite reductase activity of deoxygenated heme proteins such as deoxyhemoglobin. It is interesting to note that the rate of NO generation from nitrite is linearly dependent on reductions in oxygen and pH levels. Indeed exogenous nitrite reduced cardiac infarct size in mice subjected to myocardial I/R injury by upregulating NO [17, 29]. Due to nitrite’s high stability in the circulation, it is an important endocrine reservoir of NO. The beneficial effect of NO, at least in rodent models, has been widely reported, but there have also been discrepant results in some models. Several studies reported that NOS inhibition protects the hearts from I/R injury [21, 58, 66] and in one report exogenous NO administration actually worsened the functional recovery following I/R [57]. Furthermore, it has been shown that the infarct modulating effect of nitrite against myocardial I/R injury was very dose-dependent in mice [17]. Collectively, those studies suggest that the therapeutic effect of NO during I/R depends on dose, source, schedule and species.\n\nOrganic nitrates have been used as short-term treatment for acute MI, decompensated heart failure, and hypertensive crisis but their value in chronic treatment has been limited due to unfavourable hemodynamic effects, short plasma half-life, and the development of clinical tolerance. Much research has been devoted to overcoming these drawbacks of organic nitrates by developing a novel class of NO-releasing drugs. NO-releasing Aspirin (NCX4016), has been developed with a timed NO-releasing property [33] and has been extensively studied in various animal models. In addition to aspirin-related inhibition of platelet aggregation, chronic treatment with NCX4016 exerted an infarct-limiting effect in rabbits, pigs, and both normal and diabetic rats during myocardial I/R while native aspirin failed to protect against infarction [5, 53, 64]. Another class of novel NO-releasing drugs is the NO-statins such as NCX 6550 which showed\nBasic Research in Cardiology (2018) 113:24 Page 3 of 7 24\n\nanti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and antiplatelet effects beyond the actions of statins alone [16, 48]. The cardioprotective properties of NO are not limited to the cGMP–PKG-dependent pathway. It has been shown that NO can directly modify proteins through protein S-nitrosylation (SNO), which has recently emerged as an important post-translational protein modification and may offer great therapeutic potential in cardiovascular diseases [9, 10, 61]. Interestingly, mitochondria-selective S-nitrosylation by mitochondrial-targeted S-nitosothiol (MitoSNO) showed an infarct-reducing effect and improved cardiac function with myocardial I/R injury when it was administered 5 min before the onset of reperfusion. Complex I generates an excessive amount of ROS early in reperfusion due to succinate-driven reverse electron transport (RET) in mitochondria during I/R [49]. A cysteine residue (Cys39) in complex I becomes susceptible to S-nitrosylation in the ischemic heart muscle whenever the absence of respiration leads to low complex I activity. S-nitrosylation of the Cys39 in the ischemic cells by MitoSNO attenuated the reactivation of Complex I with reperfusion and the resulting lethal burst of ROS [10, 43]. The cardioprotective action of MitoSNO persisted in cardiomyocyte-specific PKG-I KO mice, indicating its independence of the cGMP–PKG pathway [10] (Fig. 1).\n\nsGC activators or stimulators\n\nOne major strategy to increase the intracellular pool of cGMP is to activate sGC [18]. NO can induce sGC’s activity upon its binding to the reduced Fe 2+ heme moiety on its β-subunit. However, oxidation of the heme moiety under pathological conditions during oxidative stress, such as diabetes, can result in reduced sensitivity of sGC to NO. Also the reduced bioavailability of NO associated with endothelial dysfunction is another factor that can limit the activity of sGC. Two classes of small molecule compounds have been developed to directly target sGC. sGC stimulators increase the catalytic activity of sGC with a reduced Fe 2+ heme moiety. These compounds work synergistically with NO. On the other hand, sGC activators can activate the enzyme when the heme moiety is oxidised or missing. sGC activators can also trigger cGMP synthesis independently of NO [18]. Both classes of drugs, sGC activators (e.g. BAY58-2667—Cinaciguat and HMR-1766—Ataciguat) [23, 36, 56] and stimulators (e.g. BAY63-6521—Riociguat, BAY60-4552, and BAY1021189—Vericiguat) [2, 42], have shown promising results in preclinical and clinical studies. Among them, Vericiguat has a dual mode of action. It sensitises sGC to endogenous NO by promoting NO–sGC binding and\n\nFig. 1 Hypothetical nitric oxide (NO)–protein kinase G (PKG) pathway. Abbreviations see text\n# Page 4 of 7\n\nBasic Research in Cardiology (2018) 113:24\n\nit also activates sGC independently of NO. Vericiguat has been structurally optimised for chronic use in heart failure (HF) patients, allowing once-a-day dosage with low pharmacokinetic variability [22]. In a Phase IIb dose-finding study, the SOCRATES-REDUCED trial, an exploratory analysis showed that Vericiguat improved left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and reduced NT-proBNP (biomarker for heart failure) at the highest dose in subjects with reduced ejection fraction heart failure (HFrEF) [25]. Vericiguat entered into a phase III clinical trial, the VICTORIA trial, in 2016 in HFrEF patients [1].\n\n# Natriuretic peptides\n\nNatriuretic peptides (NPs) augment the intracellular level of cGMP via pGC [46]. NPs such as ANP and BNP are upregulated to compensate loss of function in failing hearts. Their elevated plasma levels also serve as well-established biomarkers for heart failure. NPs have shown multiple pharmacological effects including diuresis, natriuresis, vasodilation and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin and aldosterone systems. There are a number of preclinical studies showing that elevating NPs results in cardioprotection against I/R injury and in hypertrophy models [8, 13, 46, 55]. Clinically, less data are available, however, the J-WIND-ANP trial showed promising results [35]. A continuous infusion of ANP for 3 days following reperfusion led to a 14.7% reduction in infarct size with reduced total creatine kinase (CK) release (66,459.9 IU/ml per h in the treated group vs. 77,878.9 IU/ml per h in controls) and a small but significant improvement in EF compared to the control group. In 2014, the PARADIGM-HF trial has shown that administration of Sacubitril, a first-in-class neprilysin inhibitor that interferes with NP degradation, resulted in a significant improvement in patients with HFrEF when it was given together with the angiotensin II receptor blocker, Valsartan [32, 41]. Following the successful clinical trials, Sacubitril/Valsartan (Entresto™) was approved for the treatment of HFrEF.\n\n# PDE inhibitors\n\nThe intracellular pool of cGMP is tightly regulated by PDEs, enzymes degrading cGMP, as an important part of cGMP–PKG pathway. There are 6 different PDE isoforms, PDE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9, that are expressed in the heart and are responsible for cGMP catabolism in the cardiovascular system. It is reported that PDE5 is predominantly responsible for hydrolysis of cGMP produced by sGC [63, 65]. PKG-I phosphorylates and activates PDE-5 by increasing its affinity to cGMP, thereby enhancing cGMP hydrolysis. This cGMP–PKG–PDE-5 signalling works efficiently as a negative feedback regulation maintaining the physiological cGMP homeostasis. The expression of PDE 5 is very low and mainly confined to smooth muscle cells under physiological conditions but it was found to be upregulated in ischemic and failing myocardium [44, 50, 59]. With such pathological changes, use of a PDE-5 inhibitor such as sildenafil, which is widely prescribed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, has shown promising results against I/R injury, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure in both preclinical and clinical settings [14, 20, 26, 38, 62]. A recent study has also demonstrated that co-treatment of a PDE-5 inhibitor, tadalafil, has a synergistic effect with the protection afforded by inhaled NO starting 30 min before reperfusion and continued for 20 min during reperfusion. This additional protection against infarction was accompanied with a significant increase of cardiac cGMP levels [40]. Although the mechanism of its protection is not fully elucidated yet, multiple studies have demonstrated that the cardioprotective effect of PDE-5 inhibitors is PKG pathway-dependent using pharmacological PKG inhibitors or selectively knocking down PKG in cardiomyocytes [15, 54]. A number of small scale clinical studies have shown favourable effects of PDE-5 inhibitors such as improved hemodynamics, left ventricular (LV) diastolic function and right ventricular (RV) systolic function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, a recent multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial, RELAX, failed to confirm a beneficial effect of sildenafil against HFpEF [52]. Based on evidence from prior clinical studies and the limitations of the RELAX trial, the authors suggested that only HF patients with reactive pulmonary hypertension are likely to benefit [34]. Apart from PDE-5, Lee et al. recently suggested PDE9A as a novel therapeutic target against heart failure [37]. PDE9A is expressed in cardiomyocytes and further upregulated by hypertrophy and heart failure. Interestingly, the study showed that PDE9A regulates cGMP produced by the NP–pGC pathway rather than the NO–sGC pathway. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PDE9A activity improved cardiac function in mice subjected to pressure overload hypertrophy by severe transverse aortic constriction (TAC). The authors proposed that PDE9A as an alternative therapeutic approach which might be effective alone or in combination with other drugs for treatment of heart failure.\n\n# Summary\n\nDespite promising results from many preclinical studies suggesting a cardioprotective effect of cGMP–PKG signalling, a number of clinical studies evaluating GC modulators and PDE 5 inhibitors have failed to show the efficacy in large cohorts. The current difficulty in translating preclinical\n# Basic Research in Cardiology (2018) 113:24\n\nPage 5 of 7 24\n\nobservation to clinical efficacy might be due to the distinct disease states derived from differences between preclinical animal models and humans [19]. For instance, subjects enrolled in clinical studies evaluating potential therapeutic tools against heart failure are likely complicated with other age-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome and other cardiovascular problems, which are often absent in preclinical animal models. Under such complex pathological condition, the efficacy of GC modulators or PDE-5 inhibitor could be limited due to the reduced sensitivity of GC to NO or the limited availability of NO, as discussed above. Based on our current understanding the complexity of such age-related diseases, employing combination therapy strategy targeting multiple mechanisms involved in the cGMP–PKG pathway, for example, targeting both NO-independent NP–pGC–cGMP and NO-dependent sCG–cGMP pathways, might be able to shed some light in the quest for new therapeutic tools against heart failure.\n\n# Compliance with ethical standards\n\nConflict of interest PS is a full-time employee of Bayer AG.\n\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.\n\n# References\n\n|1.|Armstrong PW, Roessig L, Patel MJ, Anstrom KJ, Butler J, Voors AA, Lam CSP, Ponikowski P, Temple T, Pieske B, Ezekowitz J, Hernandez AF, Koglin J, O’Connor CM (2017) A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of the oral soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator: the VICTORIA trial.

Box 56, 00014 University of Helsinki, Finland.\nEmail: heikki.ruskoaho@helsinki.fi\n\n# Abstract\n\nVarious strategies have been applied to replace the loss of cardiomyocytes in order to restore reduced cardiac function and prevent the progression of heart disease. Intensive research efforts in the field of cellular reprogramming and cell transplantation may eventually lead to efficient in vivo applications for the treatment of cardiac injuries, representing a novel treatment strategy for regenerative medicine.\n\nModulation of cardiac transcription factor (TF) networks by chemical entities represents another viable option for therapeutic interventions. Comprehensive screening projects have revealed a number of molecular entities acting on molecular pathways highly critical for cellular lineage commitment and differentiation, including compounds targeting Wnt- and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-signaling. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that GATA4 and NKX2-5 are essential TFs in gene regulation of cardiac development and hypertrophy. For example, both of these TFs are required to fully activate mechanical stretch-responsive genes such as atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). We have previously reported that the compound 3i-1000 efficiently inhibited the synergy of the GATA4–NKX2-5 interaction. Cellular effects of 3i-1000 have been further characterized in a number of confirmatory in vitro bioassays, including rat cardiac myocytes and animal models of ischemic injury and angiotensin II-induced pressure overload, suggesting the potential for small molecule-induced cardioprotection.\n\n# K E Y W O R D S\n\nmedicinal chemistry, protein function, transcription factors, transcriptional regulation\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nA network of cardiac transcription factor (TF) controls cardiac gene expression and has a central role in transcriptional regulation during cardiac differentiation and development and the adaptive pathophysiological processes in the adult heart. Evolutionarily conserved cardiac TFs GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), NK2 homeobox 5 (NKX2-5), myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), heart and neural\n\nsignaling protein 4 (GATA4), NK2 homeobox 5 (NKX2-5), myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), heart and neural\n\nenhancer factor 2C (HAND2), and serum response factor (SRF) play crucial roles in cardiac development and function.4–6\n\nAmong these TFs, GATA4 has been extensively studied due to its essential role in cardiac gene expression and its involvement in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.7–9 GATA4 is a zinc finger TF that binds to the consensus DNA sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) and regulates the expression of genes involved in cardiac development, hypertrophy, and stress response.10,11\n\nRecent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting GATA4 for therapeutic purposes in cardiac repair and regeneration. Small molecules that modulate the activity of GATA4 have shown promising results in preclinical models of cardiac injury.12,13 In particular, compounds that disrupt the interaction between GATA4 and its cofactors, such as NKX2-5, have emerged as potential candidates for pharmacological intervention in heart disease.14,15\n\nIn this review, we discuss the current understanding of GATA4 function in cardiac biology and the therapeutic implications of targeting GATA4 for cardiac repair. We summarize the molecular mechanisms underlying GATA4 activity, the regulatory networks in which GATA4 participates, and the potential strategies for modulating GATA4 function in the context of heart disease. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in the development of small molecule inhibitors of GATA4 and their potential applications in regenerative medicine and heart failure therapy.\n\nOverall, targeting GATA4 represents a promising approach for promoting cardiac repair and regeneration, and further research in this area may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for heart disease.\n\nAbbreviations: ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; BNP, brain natriuretic peptide; ChIP-seq, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing; CREP, cAMP-response element binding protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ET-1, endothelin-1; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; hiPSC, human-induced pluripotent stem cells; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; PDB, protein data bank; PE, phenylephrine; STAT-1, signal transducer and activator of transcription-1; SUMO-1, small ubiquitin-like modifier-1; TF, transcription factor; TGF, transforming growth factor.\n\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\n© 2019 The Authors.

In particular, the pioneer TF GATA4 has emerged as the nuclear effector of several cardiac signaling pathways that modulate key cardiac cascades through post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions.\n\nIn humans, the evolutionarily conserved GATA-family of proteins consists of six GATA proteins (GATA1-6), all sharing similar tertiary protein structures and high amino acid sequence identity over their two DNA binding zinc finger domains. Both N-terminal- and C-terminal zinc atoms in the GATA family are tetrahedrally coordinated and bound to four cysteine residues (Cys 4) forming the protein domains involving two β-sheets and one α-helix. The stable N-terminal zinc finger of GATA4 is primarily responsible for mediating physical interaction and gene repression via binding to friend of GATA2 protein (FOG2), whereas the vast majority of the synergistic heterotypic interactions of GATA4 are physically mediated by the C-terminal zinc finger and its C-terminal extension. In comparison to human and animal genomes, the GATA TF families are comparatively large in plant model organisms, with approximately 30 members in Arabidopsis thaliana and 64 members in soya beans. Furthermore, a recent study in plants suggests that two important processes during plant development, greening and photosynthesis, as well as stomata formation, and thus, gas exchange, are regulated by plant GATA-factors.\n\n# GATA4 STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION\n\nThe protein sequence of human GATA4 contains multiple functional domains, including the C- and N-terminal zinc fingers, in addition to the N-terminal and C-terminal sequences, which have been suggested to constitute transcriptional activation and nuclear localization domains. The truncated protein structure of the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA4 has been experimentally resolved with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium (protein data bank [PDB] code, 2M9W). However, the first NMR-structures of the zinc finger domain for GATA1 (PDB, 1GAT) were published in 1993. Furthermore, X-ray crystallographic binding analyses of other GATA-family zinc fingers bound to DNA have provided new insights into the DNA recognition mechanisms of GATA-dependent gene regulation.\n\nThe human GATA4 protein contains 442 amino acids and includes two structurally stable zinc finger domains located at amino acid residues 217–241 and 271–295. The protein sequence outside of the zinc finger core domains and C-terminal extension (residues 210–320) has no globular structure and it remains completely disordered. In addition, the C-terminal extension of the zinc finger contains the amino acid sequence required for nuclear localization.\n\nSeveral GATA4 single point mutations identified from humans have been shown to be linked to common developmental anomalies and mortality in newborns. For example, the heterozygous G296S missense mutation of GATA4 results in diminished DNA binding affinity, diminished transcriptional activity, and abolition of a physical interaction between GATA4 and TBX5 that is associated with congenital heart disease. Moreover, four heterozygous missense GATA4 mutations, P36S, H190R, S262A, and V399G, have been linked to congenital atrial-septal defects in newborns.\n\n|Transcription factor|Size|Isoforms|Structural classification|Interacting partners|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|GATA4|442 aa|2|Zinc finger protein|NKX2-5, TBX5, MEF2C|\n|NKX2-5|324 aa|3|Homeobox protein|GATA4, TBX5|\n|MEF2C|473 aa|6|MADS-box superfamily|GATA4, p300|\n|TBX5|518 aa|3|T-box protein|GATA4, NKX2-5|\n|SRF|508 aa|1|MADS-box superfamily|GATA4, ELK4, myogenin|\n|HAND2|217 aa|2|Basic helix–loop–helix protein|GATA4, NKX2-5|\n|FOG2|1,151 aa|3|Zinc finger protein|GATA4|\n# Variable DNA-binding modes of GATA-proteins\n\n|FIGURE 1|Opposite DNA-binding of C-terminal zinc fingers of GATA3 (PDB, 3DFX)|\n|---|---|\n| |Adjacent DNA-binding of C-terminal zinc fingers of GATA3 (PDB, 3DFV)|\n| |Both N- and C-terminal zinc fingers of GATA1 bound to palindromic DNA recognition site (PDB, 3VD6)|\n| |Both N- and C-terminal zinc fingers of GATA3 bind on different DNA molecules, thereby bridging two independent and separate DNA fragments suggesting a mechanisms of DNA looping and long-range gene regulation. This finding was confirmed in solution by an in-gel fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis (PDB, 4HC7)14 and are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality with myocyte apoptosis and a reduction in both mRNA and in affected individuals.|\n\nThe GATA4 protein was originally discovered as one of the earliest molecular markers associated with the initiation of cardiac gene expression. In addition to the heart, GATA4/5/6 proteins are expressed in various tissues, including the liver, lung, gut, and gonad. The other GATA family proteins, GATA1/2/3, are preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells.\n\nKnockout studies of GATA4/5/6 proteins during embryonic heart development in Xenopus, zebrafish, and mice propose a functional redundancy between these TFs. Moreover, a number of studies have demonstrated that none of the GATA factors are absolutely required for the specification of myocardium, suggesting a compensatory mechanism inside the GATA family.\n\nOn one hand, it appears that total control of GATA4 mRNA levels is not a critical predictor of GATA4 activity in model systems of hypertrophy. Over the course of experiments, mRNA levels of GATA4 remained stable in response to arginine-8-vasopressin infusion, nephrectomy in vivo and treatment with endothelin-1 (ET-1) in vitro, whereas exposure to phenylephrine (PE), isoproterenol or cardiomyocyte stretch in vitro were able to increase GATA4 mRNA levels.\n\nOn the other hand, treatment with cardiotoxic anthracyclines were associated with myocyte apoptosis and a reduction in both mRNA and protein levels of GATA4. Overall, these results indicate that activity of the myocardial GATA4 protein is preferably controlled by post-transcriptional and post-translational processes.\n\nThe GATA family of proteins has shown high variance in their cellular protein stability and degradation rate. GATA2 protein has a relatively short half-life (approximately 30 min) in comparison to GATA3 and GATA6, which have half-lives over 3 hr when studied with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. However, the half-life of GATA1 and GATA4 proteins far exceeds the other members of the GATA-family, with half-lives of greater than 6 hr. In general, the protein degradation rate plays an important role in protein displacement from the chromatin, especially in the case of related proteins, and therefore has a major impact on the establishment of transcription networks that control gene expression.\n\nThe adult human heart has insufficient capacity to repair or regenerate cardiac cells after injury when a significant number of cardiomyocytes are lost. Scar formation and failure to regenerate the injured myocardium are the primary causes of the development of heart failure, arrhythmias and sudden death.\n\nSignaling pathways and regulatory mechanisms that are active during embryogenesis and are involved in heart growth and development may be used to repair the\n# VÄLIMÄKI AND RUSKOAHO\n\ninjured adult heart. The overexpression of cardiac GATA4 protein preserves cardiac function after cardiac injury by promoting increased angiogenesis and reduced fibrosis. Moreover, genetic enhancement of GATA4 protein was able to prevent cardiotoxicity. A study by Malek Mohammadi et al. demonstrated that high abundance of cardiac GATA4 by adenoviral gene transfer at postnatal days 1–7 markedly improved cardiac regeneration after cryoinjury and rescued the loss of regenerative capacity. Accordingly, larger myocardial scars were observed in cardiomyocyte-specific GATA4 knockout mice after cryoinjury, accompanied by reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation and reduced myocardial angiogenesis.\n\nIn addition, molecular mechanisms of active cell populations responsible for the regenerative capacity of zebrafish have been linked to the expression of GATA4 within a week of cardiac injury. These results in zebrafish suggest the primary contribution and association of GATA4-positive cells to heart regeneration and repair.\n\n# 2.1 | GATA4 post-translational modifications\n\nThe function of GATA4 protein is modified by enzymes through post-translational processes, where one or more functional groups are covalently attached to or detached from the protein. Experimental studies show that post-translational modifications of GATA4 involve the assignment of acetyl-, phosphoryl-, sumo-, and ubiquitin moieties. In cells, post-translational modifications have an impact on several different functions of GATA4, involving nuclear localization, DNA binding affinity, coprotein association, and protein degradation.\n\nThe sequence of GATA4 protein conveys seven potential phosphorylation sites that are modified by enzymes, such as glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In response to hypertrophic stimuli, activation of the MAPK kinase signaling cascade significantly augments GATA4 phosphorylation and DNA binding efficiency. The importance of phosphorylation was further evaluated by in vivo experiments with knock-in mice carrying the homozygous GATA4-S105A mutation, which demonstrated the compromised stress response of the myocardium. In addition, earlier studies have shown that GATA4 phosphorylation via the MAPK/ERK pathway at Ser105 gives the tendency to be more resistant to cellular degradation. In contrast, phosphorylation of the amino-terminal part of GATA4 via activation of GSK-3β resulted in increased export of GATA4 from the nucleus.\n\nHistone acetyltransferases such as p300 and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREP) have been shown to induce the acetylation of specific lysine residues through TFs regulate gene expression through coprotein assemblies together with basal transcriptional machinery by binding to\n\nphysically interacting with GATA4. Analogous to phosphorylation, GATA4 acetylation is similarly recognized as an imperative stimulus-triggered mechanism that regulates cardiac hypertrophy by enhancing its DNA binding efficiency and transcriptional activity. Mutational analysis through alanine scanning by Takaya et al. identified four lysine residues (K311, K318, K320, K322) as targets of acetylation by p300. Mutation of all four residues blocked GATA4 acetylation and blunted cardiac hypertrophy induced by GATA4 overexpression, thus demonstrating the importance of GATA4 acetylation in the regulation of GATA4 transcriptional activity. A recent study identified K311 (corresponding to K313 in the paper) as a primary target of acetyltransferases p300/CREP, with an enhanced cellular stability of acetylated GATA4. The study was carefully conducted to simulate the effect of loss-of-function by using lysine to arginine mutations for the optimal structural integrity of the mutated proteins. Other studies have also reported that acetylated GATA4 is more resistant to degradation, perhaps due to competition with lysine ubiquitination. Furthermore, a pharmacological study with trichostatin A demonstrated that acetylation of both GATA4 and histone residues are involved in the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into cardiac myocytes.\n\n# 2.2 | GATA4 chromatin occupancy\n\nTFs regulate gene expression through coprotein assemblies together with basal transcriptional machinery by binding to\n# 72 VÄLIMÄKI AND RUSKOAHO\n\nspecific cis-regulatory sequences in gene promoters and enhancers. The tissue-specific TF GATA4 prefers to bind to the DNA sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) through its carboxy-terminal zinc finger and is responsible for mediating site-specific physical interaction with the DNA sequence. A number of essential cardiac-expressed genes contain the binding sequence for GATA in their promoter, including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP),63 B-type natriuretic factor (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]),64 α-myosin heavy chain,65 β-myosin heavy chain,66 cardiac troponin C,67 cardiac troponin I,68 and sodium-calcium exchanger.69\n\nIn the adult heart, whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis with GATA4 antibody identified only 1,756 GATA4-bound regions,70 whereas bioChIP-seq in adult heart ventricles identified more than 15,000 binding sites for the high-affinity FLAG-biotin incorporated into GATA4,71 indicating a major difference in detection sensitivity related to the antibodies used in the experiment. During cardiac development, a high-affinity ChIP-seq system identified over 50,000 GATA4-bound regions from the fetal heart ventricles. However, the less sensitive GATA4 antibody-based chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP-seq identified 11,915 GATA4-bound regions. Overall, the ChIP-seq experiments indicate a dynamic change of GATA4 chromatin occupancy through normal heart development, in concert with its changing function. In the fetal heart, GATA4-bound regions were predominantly located distal from the transcription start sites, while in the adult heart, a significant shift of GATA4 regions to proximal locations were observed. In the adult heart, pathological stress, such as chronic pressure overload, induced changes in GATA4 chromatin occupancy. The main stress-induced differences of GATA4 recruitment were associated with completely new disease enhancers that were not occupied during development, as well as the partial reinitiation of the developmental program through GATA4 binding to a subset of fetal GATA4 enhancers.71\n\nChromatin remodeling controls gene expression by modifying the access of regulatory transcription machinery proteins to condensed genomic DNA. This genome-wide remodeling process occurs via two different mechanisms, either by covalent histone modifications or by moving, ejecting, or restructuring the nucleosomes. Since gene activation is regulated in a multifaceted manner by the interplay of the TF network and the dynamic modifications of the chromatin landscape, as well as by the interference of microRNA (miRNAs), GATA4 chromatin occupancy alone was not directly associated to increased cardiac gene expression levels in fetal or adult heart. However, a number of studies have revealed a high correlation of genome-wide enrichment of GATA4 binding regions, particularly to acetylated histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), a major active transcriptional enhancer marker, together leading to a strong combined effect on gene activation.17,71–73 Indeed, the binding strength of GATA4 did not correlate with the level of GATA4 target gene transcription assessed by ChIP-seq, whereas the increased expression of GATA4-bound genes was associated with higher H3K27ac enrichment at GATA4-bound regions.\n\nIn human and mouse, there are approximately 2,000 TFs, more than 100 different modifications of histone residues, and approximately 700 miRNAs that modulate the mRNA profiles corresponding to approximately 20,000 genes. The TF complexes that are associated with GATA4 have a comparable dependency on cofactor binding and modulation by histone modifications, as well as on regulation by miRNAs. Therefore, tissue-specific chromatin co-occurrence with distinct subsets of TFs are preferred to allow a logical and systematic initiation/repression of transcription. Distinct cardiac TFs, such as NKX2-5, TBX5, SRF, and MEF2A, in addition to enhancers such as p300, have been shown to localize together with GATA4 at chromatin regions and coregulate cardiac gene expression.74,75 Even though these TFs are expressed in multiple tissues, ChIP-seq experiments provide unbiased support for collaborative TF interactions in driving cardiac-specific gene expression, which is especially linked to combinatorial localization and interactions between these cardiac TFs.\n\n# 3 GATA4 ASSOCIATION TO THE CARDIAC TRANSCRIPTIONAL NETWORK\n\nHereafter, we focus on GATA4 and its association with the interdependent cardiac TF system involving NKX2-5, MEF2C, HAND2, SRF, and TBX5, which strictly controls the context-dependent processes of cardiomyocyte development, maturation, and survival (Figure 2).27,45 All these TFs regulate each other's expression and DNA binding preferences in a combinatorial manner, resulting in a buffering capacity of the network.76 Perturbation of the core TF network with chemical treatment or genetic alteration may lead to various cardiac phenotypes in mice, and mutations in humans have been associated with congenital heart defects. Although TFs are the main driving force for the precise control of gene expression, coregulators, epigenetic marks, and post-transcriptional regulators, such as microRNAs, fine-tune their expression and functional activity.76,77 The combinatorial nature of TFs is facilitated by protein flexibility, which maximizes the specificity of promiscuous coprotein interactions. Due to combinatorial actions, a relatively small subset of TFs is able to control the transcriptional program of an entire cell.78–80\n\nHeterotypic pair-wise interactions of GATA4 have revealed that cofactors critical for direct cardiac reprogramming, such as MEF2C, HAND2, and TBX5, tend to synergistically activate the GATA cis-regulatory element.17,18,81,82 The dominant\n# VÄLIMÄKI AND RUSKOAHO\n\nZFPM2\n\n| | | |TBXS|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| | |NKX2-5| |\n| | |GATA4| |\n| | | |HANDZ|\n|HOPX|MYOCD| |BMP4|\n| |MEF2C| | |\n| |SRF|MyoG|MYODI|\n|LMKLI|FOS|MAPK14| |\n| | | |MAPK7|\n\n# FIGURE 2\n\nCardiac protein association map derived from the STRING database illustrates the network of interactions for selected TFs; GATA4, NKX2-5, MEF2C, HAND2, SRF, and TBX5.

Diverse preprogrammed gene activation patterns are therefore consequences of operative selectivity arising from molecular conformations of the core factors at the promoter (Figure 3). Moreover, selected heterotypic GATA4 protein ensembles are capable of cooperating in cardiomyocytes through a single recognition DNA element, excluding the GATA4–TBX5 interaction, which requires binding elements for both TFs. Thus, understanding protein assembly and consequent gene regulation via an inside out approach, starting from pair-wise heterotypic interactions as a core for more complex protein ensembles may further clarify the role of single TFs in gene regulation.\n\n# 4 | GATA4-TARGETED SMALL MOLECULE INTERVENTIONS\n\nThere is currently only one report that presents research of direct GATA4-targeted small molecule compounds. A study by El-Hachem and Nemer utilized the integration of in silico and in vitro cell-based screening assays to uncover charged small molecules that selectively and efficiently inhibited the DNA binding of GATA4. Two corresponding regions of the C-terminal zinc finger domain of the NMR structure of chicken GATA1 and the crystal structure of murine GATA3 were utilized as highly conserved structural templates for the virtual screening campaign. A study by El-Hachem and Nemer identified four compounds that inhibit GATA4 binding to DNA and in vitro blocked the activation of GATA4 downstream target genes and enhanced a mouse model of myoblast differentiation into myotubes. However, the use of negatively charged study compounds, which all contained zinc chelating moieties, were restricted entirely to in vitro assays due to the compounds' unoptimized and insufficient absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties. The study was not able to confirm direct ligand binding to GATA4 or exclude possible ligand chelation to the zinc ion. Furthermore, since reduced protein and activity levels of GATA4 are linked to several adverse effects in cardiomyocyte differentiation, cardiomyocyte proliferation, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and drug-induced cardiotoxicity, application of DNA inhibitors of GATA4 protein may include potential risks for unfavorable cardiac effects in vivo.\n\n# 4.1 | The GATA4–NKX2-5 interaction in cardiac development and hypertrophy\n\nNK-2 TF-related, locus 5 (NKX2-5 or Csx) is a cardiac specific homeobox gene family protein with a single helix-turn-helix motif responsible for binding to the specific consensus DNA sequence T(C/T)AAGTG. Evolutionarily conserved NKX2-5 is a critical GATA4 cofactor and has an essential role in cardiac gene expression and normal heart development. To date, approximately 50 human mutations of NKX2-5 have been identified that are associated with congenital heart defects responsible for the development of atrial septal defects, tetralogy of Fallot, and ventricular septal defects. Structural evaluations demonstrate that NKX2-5 cooperates with cardiac TFs such as GATA4 and TBX5 through the homeodomain and its C-terminal extension and synergistically promote cardiac gene expression, differentiation, and morphogenesis. More specifically,\n# Figure 3\n\nCardiac transcriptional activity is regulated by interplay of the GATA4 transcription factor with several other TFs and post-translational modifications. The vast majority of the protein associations of GATA4 are mediated by the C-terminal zinc finger, while the N-terminal zinc finger is responsible for interactions with the friend of GATA2 (FOG2). Cardiac specific heterotypic interactions and DNA occupation preferences for pair-wise GATA4 ensembles are categorized based on experimental measurements of the protein and DNA binding modes. Specific context-dependent GATA4 protein subconsortiums regulate both the commitment of stem cells toward the cardiac fate and hypertrophic gene expression in mature cardiac cells.

Together GATA4 and NKX2-5 directly interact and synergistically activate several cardiac genes including those encoding ANP and BNP. As the precise balance of the GATA4–NKX2-5 interaction is important for cardiac gene expression and mechanical stretch-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, the functional modulation of their interactions could present a novel approach for cardiac repair in pathophysiological conditions.\n\nStructural and functional data of key cardiac TF complexes are of major importance to enhance the understanding of molecular mechanisms and TF functions. Our previous study with GATA4–NKX2-5 proteins showed that several single point mutations of GATA4 are capable of interfering or activating the GATA4–NKX2-5 interaction, indicating that this PPI can be targeted by direct inhibition, activation or allosteric modulation. We established homology models of GATA4 and NKX2-5 and evaluated the point mutations having critical effects on the GATA4–NKX2-5 interaction. Preceding studies had shown that the second zinc finger and a C-terminal extension were required for physical contact with NKX2-5, and therefore, we mainly focused on these structurally stable regions. Furthermore, the point mutations were selected to evenly cover the surface of the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA4, excluding the amino acids needed for DNA binding. In total, 13 C-terminal zinc finger point mutations (R264A, S269C, A271V, N272D, N272S, Q274H, S269C + Q274H, R283A, R283Q, E288G, E288K, M298Y, K299A) and four C-terminal extension mutations (R319C, R319S, P321C, S327A) of GATA4 protein were generated together with two mutations produced in the N-terminal zinc finger (V217Y, H234S). Since all mutations were located outside the antibody recognition site, western blots quantified the mutant protein levels produced in mammalian COS-1 cells. The GATA4–NKX2-5 interaction was assessed via coimmunoprecipitation with N-terminal FLAG-NKX2-5 and analyzed by western blots using GATA4 and NKX2-5 antibodies. Moreover, the DNA binding capacity of GATA4 mutations was evaluated. The results identify specific residues R264, N272, Q274, R283, M298, K299, and R319 within the C-terminal zinc finger domain of GATA4 and its C-terminal extension that were involved in physical and functional interaction with NKX2-5. Integration of the experimental data with computational modeling suggests that the topology of the GATA4–NKX2-5 interaction is reminiscent of that observed between the DNA binding domains of nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors have two zinc fingers packed\n# VÄLIMÄKI AND RUSKOAHO\n\ntogether with a conserved set of residues mediating stability of the domain. Our model predicts that the interaction between GATA4 and NKX2-5 share a conserved architecture with the DNA binding domain of nuclear receptors. Another recent study employing molecular dynamics simulations suggests an alternative protein–protein interaction model for GATA4-NKX2-5 complex. Conversely, experimental studies do not find support for this theoretical observation.\n\n# Compounds targeted to the GATA4–NKX2-5 interaction\n\nBased on the structural and functional data of the GATA4–NKX2-5 interaction, an extensive chemical screening project was established incorporating computational and experimental biology to uncover compounds acting on key cardiac TFs. Targeting a protein–protein interaction with a small molecule is challenging due to the large surface area involved in protein–protein binding and the lack of clear binding pockets at many protein–protein interfaces. Therefore, the discovery approach consisted of several recurring methods, including GATA4-NKX2-5 co-immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays specifically developed to explore chemical agents possessing either agonistic or antagonistic effects on GATA4–NKX2-5 transcriptional synergy. Fragment-based screening, virtual screening docking and pharmacophore methods, were accordingly employed to identify primary hit compounds. Initial low molecular weight fragments were extensively modified with different structural options through chemical synthesis to improve the affinity of the molecular scaffold. The screening project resulted in synergy inhibitory compounds, including N-[4-(diethylamino)phenyl]-5-methyl-3-phenylisoxazole-4-carboxamide (IC50 3 μM), and synergy activator compound N-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-methyl-N-(4-methyl-4,5-dihydrothiazol-2-yl)-3-phenylisoxazole-4-carboxamide. The structure–activity relationship of inhibitory compounds demonstrated that ligand affinity associates to the two heavy atom linkers and hydrogen acceptors next to the five-member ring, while the agonistic effect was achieved by introducing a substituted five-member ring into the amide bond. The most potent inhibitory and activator compounds were tested in various hypertrophy assays. In cardiomyocyte cultures, the compounds either augmented or inhibited ET-1- and PE-induced increases in ANP and BNP gene expression, in line with inhibition or activation of the GATA4–NKX2-5 interaction. Moreover, the inhibitory compound 3i-1000 significantly reduced mechanical stretch induced hypertrophic growth reflected by an increase in cardiomyocyte cell size and ANP and BNP mRNA levels in response to mechanical stretch.\n\nIn vivo experiments showed that inhibition of GATA4–NKX2-5 transcriptional synergy has beneficial effects on cardiac function and gene expression in several experimental models of myocardial ischemia and pressure overload. Echocardiographic evaluation showed significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening and significant attenuation of myocardial structural changes in 3i-1000 treated mice after myocardial infarction. Accordingly, the increase of natriuretic peptide gene expression caused by myocardial infarction and the increase in ANP gene expression induced by myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury were significantly decreased by 3i-1000 in mice. Furthermore, compound 3i-1000 improved cardiac function in an experimental model of angiotensin II-mediated hypertension in rats. Optimization of primary modulators of GATA4–NKX2-5 interactions are ongoing to improve metabolite and safety profiles and determine the direct protein targets of transcriptional synergy inhibition associated with molecular mechanism(s) of action.\n\nIt is also noteworthy to point out other challenges that would come from attempting to disrupt GATA4 activity. Beyond the fact that GATA4 is an essential TF in cardiac cells, it is also expressed and functional in many other tissues, prominent among these the pancreas, liver, and lung. In addition, the targeting should be specific for GATA4 and not interfere with activities of sister genes, particularly GATA5 and GATA6. Therefore, strategies to limit off-targeting of other organs and other TFs should be developed. One opportunity to limit off-targeting of other organs would be to develop nanotherapies targeted to the injured region of the myocardium with the potential for spatial and temporal control of drug delivery. Overall, to consider GATA4 a bonafide drug target, the challenges of selectively targeting GATA4 and the injured myocardium should be addressed in more detail.\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nCurrent therapies for the treatment of myocardial remodeling are shown to attenuate symptoms and prolong lifespan by reducing the workload of the heart, for example, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. However, prognosis of patients remains poor with present-day pharmacological treatments. Cell transplantation and virus-mediated TF delivery therapies aim to replace damaged cells with new functional cardiomyocytes by utilizing hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and stem cell transplantation, and by reprogramming nonmuscle cells towards cardiomyocytes. However, providing therapeutic value with cell transplants and virus-carried TFs remains a challenge due to poor integration of new cells into the heart and the safety concerns of gene therapy. Modulation of cardiac signaling pathways and TF networks by chemical entities may represent another viable\noption for therapeutic intervention. Nonimmunogenic and cost-effective small molecules possess significant advantages of cell permeability and management of standardized industrial production and quality assurance. Our recent results (3xNKE reporter assay, ET-1 and PE-stimulated gene expression of ANP and BNP, hypertrophic cell surface growth in cardiomyocytes, and immunoprecipitation assays) demonstrate that compounds acting on GATA4-NKX2-5 transcriptional synergy can modulate the hypertrophic response in cardiomyocytes in vitro. In addition, we have shown that 3i-1000, a small molecule inhibitor of GATA4-NKX2-5 transcriptional synergy, provides cardioprotective effects in vivo, indicating that modulators of protein–protein interactions of key TFs may present novel pharmaceuticals for cardiac remodeling and repair.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nWe thank Robert Leigh for language editing.

Thus, this study was designed to explore the effects of tripartite motif protein 11 (TRIM11) on cardiomyocytes I/R injury and its underlying mechanism. Cardiomyocytes AC16 were used to establish an I/R injury cell model. After TRIM11 downregulation in I/R cells, cell proliferation (0, 12, 24, and 48 h) and apoptosis at 48 h as well as the related molecular changes in oxidative stress‐related pathways was detected. Further, after the treatment of TRIM11 overexpression, SP600125, or DUSP1 overexpression, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and related genes were detected again. As per our findings, it was determined that TRIM11 was highly expressed in the cardiomyocytes AC16 after I/R injury. Downregulation of TRIM11 was determined to have significantly reduced I/R‐induced proliferation suppression and apoptosis. Besides, I/R‐activated c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK) signaling and cleaved caspase 3 and Bax expression were significantly inhibited by TRIM11 downregulation. In addition, the overexpression of TRIM11 significantly promoted apoptosis in AC16 cells, and JNK1/2 inhibition and DUSP1 overexpression potently counteracted the induction of TRIM11 overexpression in AC16 cells. These suggested that the downregulation of TRIM11 attenuates apoptosis in AC16 cells after I/R injury probably through the DUSP1‐JNK1/2 pathways.\n\nKey Words\n\napoptosis, caspase 3, ischemia/reperfusion injury, JNK1/2 pathways, TRIM11\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nAcute myocardial infarction (MI) refers to myocardial ischemic necrosis which is mainly caused by severe coronary stenosis and myocardial insufficiency due to coronary atherosclerosis or coronary embolism, inflammation, sputum, and coronary occlusion (Hausenloy et al., 2016; Heusch & Gersh, 2016; Rentrop & Feit, 2015). During the rescue and treatment of ischemic diseases, medical scientists have gradually discovered that myocardial reperfusion therapy, rather than ischemia, is the main cause of tissue damage. Currently, myocardial reperfusion therapy has been identified to be essential; however, studies have shown that reperfusion can induce cardiomyocyte necrosis, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased lipid peroxides, large amounts of free radicals, and the inhibition of myocardial function such as malignant.\n\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution‐NonCommercial‐NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non‐commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made.\n\n© 2021 The Authors.

Thus, identifying novel therapeutic approaches that reduce myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is deemed of great importance. Tripartite motif proteins (TRIMs), characterized by three unique structural domains, including a RING finger, a B‐box, and a coiled‐coil, have been reported to be involved in a variety of cellular processes such as development and oncogenesis (Crawford et al., 2018; Hatakeyama, 2017; Petrera & Meroni, 2012; Tocchini & Ciosk, 2015). There are multiple TRIMs found to have a function in I/R injury. For example, TRIM72, also known as MG53, can ameliorate I/R injury in various organs such as the heart, lung, kidney, and brain (Duann et al., 2015; Jia et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Yao et al., 2016). The knockdown of TRIM47 can attenuate cerebral I/R injury by inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation (Hao et al., 2019), whereas a deficiency in TRIM8 can relieve hepatic I/R injury. Tao et al. (2019) TRIM11 is a novel humanin (HN)‐interacting protein, and it has been found that TRIM11 binds to HN and can downregulate HN levels. Niikura et al. (2003) HN, which originated from the mitochondrial genome, is a newly discovered 24‐amino acid polypeptide that provides cardioprotection against cardiac I/R injury (Muzumdar et al., 2010; Thummasorn et al., 2016). Mitogen‐activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are described as a group of evolutionarily conserved serine‐threonine protein kinases. They are activated by a series of extracellular stimuli and mediate signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus, regulating a number of physiological activities such as inflammation, apoptosis, canceration, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells. The activation of MAPKs has been identified as a consequence of the early events following I/R injury. Toledo‐Pereyra et al. (2004) Studies have related extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) and c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK), which are members of the MAPK superfamily, to I/R injury (Lai et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2013). For example, tyrosol can prevent I/R‐induced cardiac injury through the mitigation of reactive oxygen species and the inactivation of ERK and JNK signaling (Sun et al., 2015). Threonine‐tyrosine dual‐specificity protein phosphatase (DUSP), also known as MAPK phosphatase, can dephosphorylate and inactivate MAPKs, ERK, p38, and JNK in a context‐dependent manner (Johnson & Lapadat, 2002; Sabathié et al., 1975). DUSP1, which is a member of DUSP, is an antiapoptotic phosphatase and is found abundantly in tissues, especially the heart, liver, and lungs (Kwak et al., 1994). Studies have revealed that DUSP1 can promote cancer progression by suppressing cancer cell apoptosis, and the inhibition of DUSP1 may be a neoadjuvant therapy for cancer via the enhancement of apoptosis (Candas & Li, 2015; Li et al., 2015; Wainstein & Seger, 2016; Wang et al., 2006). In cardiac I/R, the antiapoptotic effect of DUSP1 has been found to unexpectedly improve cardiac I/R injury (Zhang et al., 2018). In addition, DUSP1 can alleviate cardiac I/R injury through the JNK pathways. Jin et al. (2018) However, whether TRIM11 can regulate the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes after I/R injury by regulating DUSP1 expression remains to be unknown. Here, we constructed a model of myocardial I/R and explored the role of TRIM11 in I/R injury, as well as its underlying mechanism. It was found that the downregulation of TRIM11 inhibited apoptosis after myocardial I/R injury through the DUSP1‐JNK1/2 pathways, thus alleviating cardiac I/R injury.\n\n# MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n# Cell culture\n\nHuman cardiomyocytes AC16 were purchased from Suzhou Beina Chuanglian Biotechnology Co., LTD (BNCC337712). In a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2, AC16 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (16000‐044, CIBCO) and 1% double antibiotic (100×, P1400, Solarbio).\n\n# TRIM11 overexpression or downregulation and DUSP1 overexpression\n\nAccording to TRIM11 (NM_145214.2) sequences, the primers were designed: TRIM11‐F: 5ʹ‐CGGAATTCATGGCCGCCCCCGAC‐3ʹ (EcoR I), TRIM11‐R: 5ʹ‐CGGGATCCTCACTGGGGAGCCAGGGTG‐3ʹ (BamH I). The coding sequences of TRIM11 containing the restriction site were amplified by Jinweizhi Gene Company following the primers. The TRIM11 coding sequence was inserted into the pLVX‐Puro vector (Clontech) through EcoR I and BamH I restriction sites to construct a pLVX‐Puro‐TRIM11 plasmid (oeTRIM11). PLVX‐Puro‐TRIM11 was mixed with psPAX2 and pMD2G packaging plasmids (Addgene) to transfect 293T cells, and the virus was harvested 48 h later. Lenti‐X GoStix (Clontech) was used to determine the virus titer, AC16 cells were infected according to multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 10. TRIM11 interference sequences (as shown in Table 1) were cloned to pLKO.1‐puro plasmids to silence TRIM11 (shTRIM11‐1/‐2/‐3). According to DUSP1 (NM_004417.4) sequences, the primers were designed: DUSP1‐F: 5ʹ‐CGGGATCCATGGTCATGGAAGTGGGCAC‐3ʹ (BamH I), DUSP1‐R: 5ʹ‐CGGAATTCTCAGCAGCTGGGAGAGGTC‐3ʹ (EcoR I). The coding sequences of DUSP1 containing the restriction site were amplified by Jinweizhi Gene Company following the primers. The DUSP1 coding sequence was inserted into the pCMV‐Tag2B vector (Addgene) through BamH I and EcoR I restriction sites to construct a pCMV‐Tag2B‐DUSP1 plasmid (oeDUSP1). pCMV‐Tag2B‐DUSP1 plasmid was mixed with psPAX2 and pMD2G packaging plasmids (Addgene) to transfect 293T cells, and the virus was harvested 48 h later. Lenti‐X GoStix (Clontech) was used to determine the virus titer, AC16 cells were infected according to MOI = 10.\n\n**TRIM11 interference sequences**\n|Name|Sequences|\n|---|---|\n|TRIM11 site 1 (672–690)|GGAGAAGTCACTGGAGCAT|\n|TRIM11 site 2 (708–726)|GGATGCGTTGCTGTTCCAA|\n|TRIM11 site 3 (746–764)|GCGTCTTGTGGCAGAAGAT|\n# Cell Biology\n\nCell transfection\n\nWhen in the logarithmic growth phase, AC16 cells and I/R injury cells were trypsinized and counted for 1 × 10^6 cells/ml suspension; then, 2 ml of suspension was inoculated into six-well plates for overnight culture at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. When the cells grow to 60%–70% confluency, I/R injury cells were transfected with shTRIM11-1/-2/-3 lentivirus (1.5 μg) by Lipo2000. AC16 cells were then transfected with oeTRIM11 or oeDUSP1 lentivirus. After 6 h of transfection, the serum-free transfer solution was replaced by the complete medium for the 48-hour culture.\n\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay\n\n# Establishment of myocardial I/R cell model\n\nIschemia was stimulated in cardiomyocytes AC16 for 3 h by incubating them with serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium in an incubator containing 1% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37°C. Next, reperfusion was carried out under normoxic conditions (21% O2, 5% CO, and 74% N2) using DMEM/F-122 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 6, 12, and 24 h. Finally, the I/R injury model for 24 h was selected for subsequent experiments.\n\n# LACTIC DEHYDROGENASE (LDH) ACTIVITY DETECTION\n\nThe levels of LDH in cells were measured using the LDH (A020-2) Kit (Nanjing, Jiancheng Biotechnology Research Institute) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Assays were performed in triplicate, and the mean values of each sample were calculated manually.\n\n# Cell proliferation assay\n\nWhen in the logarithmic growth phase, I/R-injured-AC16 cells after 48 h of transfection were trypsinized and counted for 5 × 10^4 cells/ml suspension; then, each well of 96-well plates was seeded with 100 μl of suspension for overnight culture at 37°C. Groups were then divided to be treated with shNC (negative control) and shTRIM11-1/-2/-3, while AC16 cells without treatment served as controls. At a volume ratio of 1:10, Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8, SAB, CP002) was mixed with serum-free DMEM medium; then, at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h of culture, 100 μl of the mixture was added to each well and incubated for 1 h. The optical density at 450 nm indicating cell proliferation was measured on a microplate reader (DNM-9602, Perlong).\n\nAfter the treatment of the I/R injury (6, 12, 24 h) or transfection (shTRIM11-1/-2/-3, oeTRIM11, and oeDUSP1), AC16 cells were collected, and then TRIzol reagent (1596-026, Invitrogen) was used to extract the total RNAs. Following quantification, Reverse Transcription Kit (#K1622, Fermentas) was used to reverse-transcribe RNA into cDNA. With an SYBR Green PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), RT-PCR, taking cDNA as templates, was conducted on the ABI 7300 Real-Time PCR system (ABI-7300, Applied Biosystems) according to the procedures: 95°C, 10 min (95°C, 15 s; 60°C, 45 s) × 40. Using the 2-△△Cq method, the mRNA expression of TRIM11 and DUSP1, relative to GAPDH, was calculated. Livak and Schmittgen (2001) All primers are listed in Table 2.\n\n# CO-IMMUNOPRECIPITATION ASSAY (CO-IP)\n\nCell lysates were extracted using IP-lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl Ph 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Anti-TRIM11 antibody (10851-1-AP, Proteintech) and anti-DUSP1 antibody (#48625, CST) were first, followed by the addition of Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose beads (50% slurry) to the precleared lysates for overnight incubation at 4°C. Rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2027) was used as a control. The beads were washed, resuspended in loading buffer (10% SDS, 0.2 m Tris pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromophenol blue (5×), 1.42 m 2-mercaptoethanol), and incubated for 30 min at 37°C before being boiled for 10 min. Finally, the antibodies of anti-TRIM11 (Ab111694, Abcam) and anti-DUSP1 (#35217, Cell Signaling Technology) were used for western blot analysis to analyze the interaction between TRIM11 and DUSP1.\n\n|Name|Primers|\n|---|---|\n|TRIM11|Primer F: 5ʹ-GCCTTCTGTGGCGACGAG-3ʹ|\n| |Primer R: 5ʹ-GCATCCTGCATCTGCTTCC-3ʹ|\n|DUSP1|Primer F: 5ʹ-ACTGCCGCTCCTTCTTCG-3ʹ|\n| |Primer R: 5ʹ-GCTCGTCCAGCAACACCAC-3ʹ|\n|GAPDH|Primer F: 5ʹ-AATCCCATCACCATCTTC-3ʹ|\n| |Primer R: 5ʹ-AGGCTGTTGTCATACTTC-3ʹ|\n\nCell apoptosis assay\n\nAnnexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) cell apoptosis detection kit (C1063, Beyotime) was used for apoptosis detection. Briefly, the cells (1 × 10^6) were gently resuspended in 195 μl of Annexin V-FITC binding solution and incubated for 15 min with 5 μl Annexin V-FITC at 4°C in the dark. Similarly, at 4°C in the dark, the cells were incubated with 5 μl of propidium iodide (PI) staining solution for 5 min. Cells without treatment of either Annexin V-FITC or PI were served as negative controls. Flow cytometry (FCM) experiments were performed immediately after cell pretreatment, and the percentage of apoptosis was evaluated using BD Accuri™ C6 (Version 1.0.264.21; BD Biosciences).\n# 4.1 Western blot analysis\n\nAfter extracting the total proteins using RIPA buffer (containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor, R0010, Solarbio), the proteins were quantified using a BCA Protein Quantitation Kit (PICPI23223, Thermo), resolved by 10% SDS‐PAGE electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (HATF00010, Millipore), blocked in skimmed milk, and then incubated with primary and secondary antibodies. The protein bands were exposed on an ECL imaging system (Tanon 5200, Tanon) after being developed using a chemiluminescent reagent (WBKLS0100, Millipore). The protein levels, relative to GAPDH, were calculated using ImageJ version 1.47v. Anti‐TRIM11 (Ab111694), anti‐cleaved caspase 3 (Ab2302), anti‐JNK1/2 (Ab179461), anti‐p‐JNK1/2 (Ab124956), p38 (1:1000, Ab59461, Abcam), and p‐p38 (1:1000, Ab4822, Abcam) from Abcam (Shanghai, China) and anti‐ERK1/2 (#9102), anti‐p‐ERK1/2 (#9101), anti‐DUSP1 (#35217), and anti‐GAPDH (#5174) antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology were used.\n\n# 4.2 Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). With at least three independent experiments, continuous data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Significance among multiple groups was analyzed using a one‐way analysis of variance with Tukey's posttest. Values of p < .05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n\n# 5 RESULTS\n\n# 5.1 TRIM11 was highly expressed in the myocardial I/R cell model\n\nAfter treatments for 6, 12, and 24 h, LDH activity was detected to ensure that the myocardial I/R cell model was successfully established. As shown in Figure 1a, LDH activity in AC16 cells after I/R injury was significantly increased in a time‐dependent manner. TRIM11 expression was detected by RT‐PCR and western blot. As shown in Figures 1b,c, both mRNA and protein expressions of TRIM11 were significantly increased in AC16 cells after I/R injury in a time‐dependent manner. Thus, the 24 h of treatment duration was selected for subsequent experiments.\n\n# 5.2 Downregulation of TRIM11 significantly inhibited the apoptosis in AC16 cells after I/R injury\n\nAfter lentivirus injection, the efficiency of TRIM11 interference was determined, and the results showed that both TRIM11 mRNA (Figure 2a) and protein (Figure 2b) expressions were significantly downregulated in AC16 cells. After I/R injury, cell proliferation was significantly reduced (Figure 2c), whereas apoptosis was significantly enhanced (Figure 2d). Currently, apoptosis‐related proteins Bax and cleaved caspase 3 were identified to have significantly increased in myocardial cells after I/R injury, whereas Bcl‐2 significantly decreased (Figure 2e). Furthermore, the protein levels of phosphorylated‐ERK1/2 (p‐ERK1/2), p‐JNK1/2, and p‐p38 were significantly increased in myocardial cells after I/R injury (Figure 2e). In addition, the downregulation of TRIM11 potently inhibited I/R injury‐induced apoptosis and JNK1/2 activation in AC16 cells, whereas I/R injury‐activated ERK1/2 and p38 did not change significantly after TRIM11 downregulation.\n\n# 5.3 TRIM11‐regulated apoptosis in AC16 cells probably through the JNK1/2 pathway\n\nNext, we explored the role of JNK1/2 pathway in TRIM11 regulating apoptosis in AC cells. The efficiency of TRIM11 overexpression was determined (Figure 3a,b). We found that the upregulation of TRIM11 significantly promoted apoptosis in AC16 cells accompanied by increased cleaved caspase 3 and Bax, decreased Bcl‐2, and increased p‐JNK1/2 level. Furthermore, JNK1/2 inhibitors could potently reverse the induction of TRIM11 overexpression (Figure 3c,d).\n\n# 5.4 The interaction between TRIM11 and DUSP1 in AC16 cells\n\nFurther, we have found that the overexpression of TRIM11 significantly decreased DUSP1 protein, whereas DUSP1 mRNA remains unchanged (Figure 4a,b). Furthermore, Co‐IP showed that TRIM11 interacted with DUSP1 (Figure 4c), and the overexpression of TRIM11 significantly promoted DUSP1 ubiquitination (Figure 4d). Consistent with this, TRIM11 overexpression was noted to significantly decrease DUSP1 protein, and MG132 (proteasome inhibitor) potently counteracted the effect of TRIM11 overexpression (Figure 4e).\n\n# 5.5 TRIM11‐regulated apoptosis in AC16 cells probably through the modulation of DUSP1 expression\n\nThe efficiency of DUSP1 overexpression was determined (Figure 5a,b). We found that the overexpression of DUSP1 significantly decreased TRIM11‐induced cleaved caspase‐3, Bax, and p‐JNK1/2, and apoptosis in myocardial cells, whereas it increased Bcl‐2 (Figure 5c,d).\n\n# 6 DISCUSSION\n\nCurrently, the prevention of ischemic diseases such as MI associated with I/R remains a challenge. TRIM11 is mainly found to play a key role in cell processes of various human cancers.\n# Cell Biology\n\nFigure 1: TRIM11 was highly expressed in the myocardial I/R cell model.

Control, AC16 cells; vector, negative control of TRIM11 overexpression including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis (Di et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). In this study, we have found that TRIM11 was highly expressed in AC16 cells after I/R injury. The downregulation of TRIM11 significantly promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in I/R‐injured AC16 cells, together with decreased cleaved caspase 3 and Bax, and increased Bcl‐2, whereas TRIM11 overexpression promoted apoptosis in AC16 cells. Caspase 3, a cysteine protease, has been reported to regulate apoptosis and act function by its activated form, cleaved caspase 3 (Brentnall et al., 2013). It is reported that TRIM47 can regulate apoptosis and inflammation by modulating caspase 3 (Hao et al., 2019). These findings suggested that the downregulation of TRIM11 may attenuate I/R injury in AC16 cells by inhibiting apoptosis. We have also investigated the potential molecular mechanism of TRIM11 in regulating I/R‐induced apoptosis in AC16 cells. MAPKs are suggested to be important regulators of apoptosis in response to myocardial I/R (Kobayashi et al., 2006). Two members of the MAPK family, that is, ERK and JNK, are often activated immediately in organs with I/R injury and play an important role in inducing apoptosis after I/R injury (Armstrong, 2004; Baines & Molkentin, 2005). For instance, the activation of the JNK signaling cascade promotes apoptosis (Chen, 2012; Dhanasekaran & Reddy, 2008), whereas ERK activation contributes to cell injury prevention (Kunduzova et al., 2002). Moreover, by activating the AMPK/ERK pathways, trimetazidine has a protective effect on the heart after I/R injury (Liu et al., 2016). Here we found that the downregulation of TRIM11 significantly inhibited the I/R‐induced activation of the JNK1/2 signaling pathway. Additionally, the inhibition of JNK1/2 potently counteracted the induction of TRIM11 overexpression in AC16 cells. A previous study demonstrated that TRIM8 deficiency is capable of alleviating apoptosis after hepatic I/R in vivo by inhibiting TAKI‐p38/JNK signaling pathway activation and also during cerebral I/R injury (Tao et al., 2019). Besides, in a variety of human diseases, the TRIM11‐mediated ERK/JNK signaling pathway has been found to participate in cellular processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis (Dai et al., 2019; Wang\n# Cell Biology\n\n| |(a)|(b)|\n|---|---|---|\n|Vector|oeTRIM11|TRIM11|\n| | |GAPDH|\n| | |DUSP1|\n| |(c)|(d)|\n|Cell lysate|IgG|DUSP1 Ab|\n|TRIM11| | |\n|DUSP1| | |\n|DUSP1| | |\n|TRIMI-| | |\n\nFIGURE 4 The interaction between TRIM11 and DUSP1 in AC16 cells (a, b).

(c) Co‐immunoprecipitation assay of the interaction between TRIM11 and DUSP1. (d) DUSP1 ubiquitination assay. (e) After oeTRIM11 or MG132 (10 μmol/L) treatment, the protein levels of TRIM11 and DUSP1 were detected.\n\nIn line with these reports, it can be inferred that TRIM11 downregulation has suppressed apoptosis in AC16 cells after I/R injury probably by inhibiting the activation of the JNK1/2 pathways.\n\nFurther, we found that DUSP1 overexpression significantly inhibited TRIM11‐induced apoptosis in AC16 cells, and its downstream JNK1/2 pathways were inactivated. It has been reported that the low expression of DUSP1 can impede the protective effect of NaHS on myocardial I/R injury (Ren et al., 2020). DUSP1 can alleviate cardiac I/R injury by suppressing mitochondrial fission and mitophagy via the JNK pathways (Jin et al., 2018). Besides, USP49 inhibits I/R‐induced cell viability suppression and apoptosis in AC16 cells via the DUSP1‐JNK1/2 pathways (Zhang et al., 2019). Altogether, we speculated that TRIM11‐regulated I/R‐induced apoptosis probably through the DUSP1‐JNK1/2 pathways.\n\nThe findings of our study indicate that TRIM11 plays a key role in cardiac I/R injury; thus, they improve our understanding of the role of TRIM11/DUSP1/JNK1/2 in apoptosis in AC16 after I/R injury. One of the limitations of this study is that the greater part of the study was performed in cell culture experiments. Thus, confirming these findings using in vivo experiments and clinical samples from patients will give us a clearer understanding of the TRIM11/DUSP1/JNK1/2 pathway in cardiac I/R injury. Although further investigations are needed, this study identifies a potential therapeutic approach for cardiac I/R injury.\n\n# CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, this study indicated that the downregulation of TRIM11 may ameliorate apoptosis in AC16 cells after I/R injury, probably through the DUSP1‐JNK1/2 pathways. This indicates that the downregulation of TRIM11 has a cardioprotective effect against I/R injury in cardiomyocytes. Therefore, targeting TRIM11 may open a new perspective for the treatment of the heart after I/R injury.\n# Cell Biology\n\nInternational\n\nFigure 5 TRIM11‐regulated apoptosis in AC16 cells probably by modulating DUSP1 expression (a, b).
