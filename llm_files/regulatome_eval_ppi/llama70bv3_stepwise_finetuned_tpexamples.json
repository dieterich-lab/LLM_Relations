Here, we report that all S1P receptors are palmitoylated. In S1P(1), three Cys residues in the cytoplasmic tail are palmitoylated. We examined the roles of palmitoylation of S1P(1) using model cells in which wild-type S1P(1) or a non-palmitoylated mutant S1P(1) was overproduced. Compared with wild-type S1P(1), the non-palmitoylated S1P(1) exhibited binding affinity similar to the natural ligand S1P but lower to the synthetic ligand FTY720 phosphate (FTY720-P), the active form of the immunomodulator FTY720. However, downstream signaling of non-palmitoylated S1P(1) was similarly affected by S1P and FTY720-P stimulation. Moreover, upon stimulation with S1P, internalization of the mutant non-palmitoylated S1P(1) was retarded, compared with that of the wild-type protein. This effect was much more pronounced with FTY720-P stimulation. Similar differences were observed for the phosphorylation of S1P(1) and its mutant. These findings may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of the pharmacological effects of FTY720. Finally, palmitoylation of wild-type S1P(1) increased upon treatment with S1P, suggesting that S1P(1) undergoes a palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle after stimulation by its ligands.",

This unique post-translational modification is thought to be distinct from similar cytosolic reactions in requiring ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and one or more putative ubiquitin carrier proteins (E2) but not isopeptide ligase (E3). Apparently homogeneous preparations of the E2 isozymes were tested for their ability to catalyze the E3-independent conjugation of ubiquitin to linker histone H1 and core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 in the presence of catalytic amounts of E1. Significant rates of nonprocessive core histone monoubiquitination were catalyzed by the E2(14kDa), E2(20kDa), and E2(32kDa) isozymes but not by either E2(17kDa) or E2(24kDa). The former three E2 isozymes also supported slow rates of direct multiple ubiquitination to secondary ligation sites on the histones. Rate studies for the monoubiquitination of H2A and H2B revealed that: 1) E2(14kDa) catalyzed a second order reaction with respect to histone concentration; 2) E2(32kDa)-mediated ligation proceeded by hyperbolic kinetics, yielding Km values of 2.8 and 12 microM for H2A and H2B, respectively; and 3) E2(20kDa) exhibited complex kinetics composed of both second order and hyperbolic pathways, the latter having Km values of 0.83 and 1.5 microM for H2A and H2B, respectively. Pulse-chase kinetics suggested that both ubiquitin thiol esters formed to E2(20kDa) were catalytically competent in H2A ligation. The active E2 isozymes also catalyzed the processive multiple ubiquitination of calf thymus H1. Other rate studies determined that Kd values for binding of the active E2 species to E1 ternary complex were 0.1 nM for E2(14kDa), 0.4 nM for E2(32kDa), and 3.6 nM for E2(20kDa). The data indicate that E2(20kDa) and E2(32kDa) are specific but mechanistically distinct ligation enzymes responsible for the conjugation of ubiquitin to nucleosomal proteins.",

    "text": "TKI are generally categorized as type I or type II inhibitors. Type I inhibitors directly compete with ATP binding to the nucleotide-binding site and make contact with the tyrosine kinase hinge region. Crystal structures of kinases in complex with inhibitors indicate that type I TKI bind target when the phosphorylated kinase activation loop assumes either the active unfolded \"open\" conformation or the inactive closed conformation. Type II inhibitors indirectly compete with ATP by binding a hydrophobic allosteric site adjacent to the nucleotide-binding site in addition to the nucleotide-binding site. These inhibitors only bind the target when the activation loop assumes the \"closed\" conformation. Dasatinib is an example of a type I inhibitor that binds BCR-ABL while imatinib and nilotinib are examples of type II inhibitors. FLT3 mutations lead to constitutive activation by two different mechanisms: ITD mutations that relieve the negative regulatory influence of the juxtamembrane domain on the catalytic domain and the AL mutants that directly destabilize the activation loop. There are suggestions that FLT3 TKI also fall into the category of type I or type II inhibitors, but the biological data from this study argue that this categorization, while technically accurate, is likely an oversimplification. Midostaurin (and lestaurtinib) is thought to be a type I inhibitor whereas sorafenib and many other FLT3 TKI are thought to belong to the type II class. Since all FLT3 TKI inhibit ITD mutations but display variable activity against kinase domain mutants, the assertion that type II FLT3 TKI are ineffective against some AL mutations because the kinase is shifted toward the active conformation seems inadequate as it should then hold true for all FLT3 AL mutations. Instead, it is more probable that the activation loop of specific FLT3 AL mutants adopts a conformation that prohibits the DFG residues from forming hydrogen bonds that are characteristic of binding with type II inhibitors, thereby reducing drug affinity. The phenylalanine in the DFG region of activated kinases has been shown to move more than 10 Aa from its position in the inhibited conformation. Almost certainly, different substitutions on the activation loop will have varying effects on the position of the DFG residues with subsequently varying effects on the ability of type II FLT3 TKI to tightly bind these mutants. An alternative explanation as to why type II inhibitors might not be effective against FLT3 AL mutants could be that some FLT3 AL mutations don't fully transition to the inactive conformation seen in the autoinhibited form where the activation loop is completely folded between the N and C kinase lobes.",

We show that the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 5, as a co-factor in a DNA damage responsive co-activator complex that interacts with p53, is responsible for methylating p53. Arginine methylation is regulated during the p53 response and affects the target gene specificity of p53. Furthermore, PRMT5 depletion triggers p53-dependent apoptosis.

DBI was originally characterized by Costa and Guidotti for its ability to displace diazepam from the benzodiazepine recognition site located on the type A receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) and later shown to physiologically modulate GABAA receptor function. The findings that TSPO was abundant in the OMM of adrenal mitochondria, and that DBI acts on the OMM to induce mitochondrial steroid formation, led to studies of the effects of well-characterized TSPO-binding families of compounds on corticosteroid and androgen formation by adrenal cortical and testicular Leydig cells, respectively. Exposure of structurally diverse TSPO ligands, including benzodiazepines, isoquinoline carboxamides and indole acetamides, to steroidogenic cell lines, primary steroidogenic cells and tissues, as well as isolated steroidogenic mitochondria, at concentrations close to their binding affinity consistently stimulates steroid synthesis 1.5-3.0-fold within minutes. Moreover, various TSPO ligands, namely flunitrazepam and 5-androsten-3beta,17,19-triol, at nanomolar and low micromolar concentrations, respectively, were able to block hormone-induced steroid formation in both cell lines and primary cells. Moreover, though not definitive proof of TSPO's involvement in steroidogenesis, DBI was shown to increase steroid formation when applied to isolated mitochondria, while its oligodeoxynucleotide-based knockdown blocked steroidogenesis in Leydig cell lines. Interestingly, DBI levels in the Leydig cells were reduced in hypophysectomized animals, suggesting a role in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal endocrine signaling axis. Two knockout DBI (ACBD1/ACBP) mouse models have been generated, resulting in either an embryonic lethality or metabolic defects, suggesting a complex and as yet unclear phenotype.",

    "text": "The processivity of multiubiquitination by the APC determines the order of substrate degradation.  The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) coordinates mitosis and G1 by sequentially promoting the degradation of key cell-cycle regulators. Following the degradation of its substrates in G1, the APC catalyzes the autoubiquitination of its E2 UbcH10. This stabilizes cyclin A and allows it to inactivate APC(Cdh1). How the APC establishes this complex temporal sequence of ubiquitinations, referred to as substrate ordering, is not understood. Here we show that substrate ordering depends on the relative processivity of substrate multiubiquitination by the APC. Processive substrates obtain ubiquitin chains in a single APC binding event. The multiubiquitination of distributive substrates requires multiple rounds of APC binding, which render it sensitive to lower APC concentrations, competition by processive substrates, and deubiquitination. Consequently, more processive substrates are preferentially multiubiquitinated in vitro and degraded earlier in vivo. The processivity of multiubiquitination is strongly influenced by the D box within the substrate, suggesting that substrate ordering is established by a mechanism intrinsic to APC and its substrates and similar to kinetic proofreading.",

Lafora disease (LD) is a fatal form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy caused by recessive mutations in either a gene encoding a dual-specificity phosphatase, known as laforin, or a recently identified gene encoding the protein known as malin. Here, we demonstrate that malin is a single subunit E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase and that its RING domain is necessary and sufficient to mediate ubiquitination. Additionally, malin interacts with and polyubiquitinates laforin, leading to its degradation. Missense mutations in malin that are present in LD patients abolish its ability to polyubiquitinate and signal the degradation of laforin. Our results demonstrate that laforin is a physiologic substrate of malin, and we propose possible models to explain how recessive mutations in either malin or laforin result in LD. Furthermore, these data distinguish malin as an E3 Ub ligase whose activity is necessary to prevent a neurodegenerative disease that involves formation of nonproteinacious inclusion bodies.",

Here we show that OCRL loss in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts impacts clathrin-mediated endocytosis and results in an endocytic defect. These cells exhibit an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clathrin-coated pits, which may result from sequestration of coat components on uncoated vesicles. Endocytic vesicles that fail to lose their coat nucleate the majority of the numerous actin comets present in patient cells. SNX9, an adaptor that couples late-stage endocytic coated pits to actin polymerization and which we found to bind OCRL directly, remains associated with such vesicles. These results indicate that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor and that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis likely contribute to pathology in patients with OCRL mutations.",

Piwi proteins are proposed to be piRNA-guided endonucleases that initiate secondary piRNA biogenesis; however, the actual contribution of their endonuclease activities to piRNA biogenesis and transposon silencing remain unknown. To investigate the role of Piwi-catalysed endonucleolytic activity, we engineered point mutations in mice that substitute the second aspartic acid to an alanine in the DDH catalytic triad of Mili and Miwi2, generating the Mili(DAH) and Miwi2(DAH) alleles, respectively. Analysis of Mili-bound piRNAs from homozygous Mili(DAH) fetal gonadocytes revealed a failure of transposon piRNA amplification, resulting in the marked reduction of piRNA bound within Miwi2 ribonuclear particles. We find that Mili-mediated piRNA amplification is selectively required for LINE1, but not intracisternal A particle, silencing. The defective piRNA pathway in Mili(DAH) mice results in spermatogenic failure and sterility. Surprisingly, homozygous Miwi2(DAH) mice are fertile, transposon silencing is established normally and no defects in secondary piRNA biogenesis are observed. In addition, the hallmarks of piRNA amplification are observed in Miwi2-deficient gonadocytes. We conclude that cycles of intra-Mili secondary piRNA biogenesis fuel piRNA amplification that is absolutely required for LINE1 silencing.",

Here we demonstrate that p120(E4F) interacts with HDAC1 in vivo and in vitro, and that E4F-mediated transcriptional repression is alleviated by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A or by overexpressing Gam1. A mutant E4 promoter unresponsive to E4F-mediated transcriptional repression is also not stimulated by Gam1.

Remarkably, not only were we able to measure RDCs of the isolated TAD, but we were also able to do so for the TAD in both the full-length tetrameric p53 protein and in its complex with a specific DNA response element. We determined the orientation of the TAD ensemble relative to the core domain, found that the TAD was stiffer in the proline-rich region (residues 64-92), which has a tendency to adopt a polyproline II (PPII) structure, and projected the TAD away from the core. We located the TAD in SAXS experiments on a complex between tetrameric p53 and four Taz2 domains that bind tightly to the TAD (residues 1-57) and acted as \"reporters.\" The p53-Taz2 complex was an extended cross-shaped structure. The quality of the SAXS data enabled us to model the disordered termini and the folded domains in the complex with DNA. The core domains enveloped the response element in the center of the molecule, with the Taz2-bound TADs projecting outward from the core.",

Tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I can be regulated in a signal-dependent manner in various cell types. In B lymphocytes, Bruton's tyrosine kinase has been identified as a TFII-I tyrosine kinase. Here we report that JAK2 can phosphorylate and regulate TFII-I in nonlymphoid cells. The activity of TFII-I on the c-fos promoter in response to serum can be abolished by dominant negative JAK2 or the specific JAK2 kinase inhibitor AG490. Consistent with this, we have also found that JAK2 is activated by serum stimulation of fibroblasts. Tyrosine 248 of TFII-I is phosphorylated in vivo upon serum stimulation or JAK2 overexpression, and mutation of tyrosine 248 to phenylalanine inhibits the ability of JAK2 to phosphorylate TFII-I in vitro. Tyrosine 248 of TFII-I is required for its interaction with and phosphorylation by ERK and its in vivo activity on the c-fos promoter. These results indicate that the interaction between TFII-I and ERK, which is essential for its activity, can be regulated by JAK2 through phosphorylation of TFII-I at tyrosine 248. Thus, like the STAT factors, TFII-I is a direct substrate of JAK2 and a signal-dependent transcription factor that integrates signals from both tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways to regulate transcription.",

Ligand binding leads to the dissociation of corepressors and the recruitment of coactivators. Many of these factors, acting in large complexes, have emerged as potential chromatin remodelers through intrinsic histone modifying activities. In addition, other ligand-recruited complexes appear to act more directly on the transcriptional apparatus. The DRIP complex is a 15-subunit complex required for nuclear receptor transcriptional activation in vitro. It is recruited to the receptor in response to ligand through specific interactions of one subunit, DRIP205. We present evidence that DRIP205 interacts with another member of the steroid receptor subfamily, estrogen receptor (ER). This interaction occurs in an agonist-stimulated fashion which in turn is inhibited by several ER antagonists. In vivo, a fragment of DRIP205 containing only its receptor interacting region acts to selectively inhibit ER's ability to activate transcription in response to estradiol. These observations suggest a key role for the DRIP coactivator complex in estrogen-ER signaling.",

Their absence from the yeasts and other eukaryotic 'microbes' suggests a specific role for them in the development of multicellular organisms. In this study, two closely related Tousled-like kinase homologs, TLK1 and TLK2, were identified in Trypanosoma brucei, a unicellular protozoan parasite. Only TLK1 plays an essential role in cell growth, and a deficiency in TLK1 led to an enrichment of S-phase cells, defective spindle formation and aberrant chromosome segregation. Although both TLK proteins localize to the nucleus, only TLK1 also concentrates in the spindle poles during mitosis. Both TLK proteins are phosphorylated by the Aurora kinase (AUK1), and both can autophosphorylate and phosphorylate histone H3 and the chromatin assembly factors Asf1A and Asf1B in vitro, but only TLK1 is autophosphorylated and capable of oligomerizing and interacting with AUK1, Asf1A and Asf1B in vivo. These discrepancies between the two TLK proteins can be attributed to minor differences between their N- and C-terminal sequences. In summary, TLK1 cooperates with Aurora kinase to regulate spindle assembly and chromosome segregation, and it performs a role in DNA replication probably by regulating histone modification in trypanosomes.",

We determined the complete cDNA sequence of the GAS41 gene, demonstrated that the GAS41 protein is evolutionarily conserved, specifically at the N-terminus, and identified the yeast transcription factor tf2f domain within the GAS41 sequence. A human multiple-tissue Northern blot revealed ubiquitous expression of GAS41 with the highest expression in human brain. After generating polyclonal antibodies we found GAS41 protein expression in the nucleus of the TX3868 cell line by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. The nuclear localization was confirmed for several human tumors including gliomas of different grades of malignancy. In neuroblastoma however, GAS41 was found in the nucleoli but not in the nucleoplasm. Yeast two-hybrid screening of the TX3868 cell line identified the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), the KIAA1009 protein, and prefoldin subunit 1 (PFDN1) as potential interacting partners of GAS41. We generated a polyclonal antibody against the KIAA1009 protein and we demonstrated that the KIAA1009 protein is a nuclear protein, which appears to be co-localized with the GAS41 protein and NuMA.",

A combination of HSP70 and HAP1 also caused a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of a DNA fragment containing an apurinic/apyrimidinic site. The functional consequence of the HSP70/HAP1 interaction was a 10-100-fold enhancement of endonuclease activity at abasic sites.

The UBE1L2 sequence displays a 40% identity to UBE1 and also contains an ATP-binding domain and an active site cysteine conserved among E1 family proteins. UBE1L2 forms a covalent link with ubiquitin in vitro and in vivo, which is sensitive to reducing conditions. In an in vitro polyubiquitylation assay, recombinant UBE1L2 could activate ubiquitin and transfer it onto the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5b. Ubiquitin activated by UBE1L2 could be used for ubiquitylation of p53 by MDM2 and supported the autoubiquitylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligases HectH9 and E6-AP.

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating AMPAR insertion remain elusive. By directly visualizing individual insertion events of the AMPAR subunit GluR1 in rodents, we found that the protein 4.1N was required for activity-dependent GluR1 insertion. Protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of the serine 816 (S816) and S818 residues of GluR1 enhanced 4.1N binding to GluR1 and facilitated GluR1 insertion. In addition, palmitoylation of GluR1 C811 residue modulated PKC phosphorylation and GluR1 insertion. Finally, disrupting 4.1N-dependent GluR1 insertion decreased surface expression of GluR1 and the expression of long-term potentiation. Our study uncovers a previously unknown mechanism that governs activity-dependent GluR1 trafficking, reveals an interaction between AMPAR palmitoylation and phosphorylation, and underscores the functional importance of 4.1N in AMPAR trafficking and synaptic plasticity.",

For example, the damaged DNA-binding protein Radiation sensitive 4 (Rad4) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is homologous to the mammalian NER protein Xeroderma Pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC). In this study, we examined the role of the Arabidopsis thaliana Rad4/XPC homologue (AtRAD4) in plant UV tolerance by generating overexpression lines. AtRAD4 overexpression, both with and without an N-terminal yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) tag, resulted in increased UV tolerance. YFP-RAD4 localized to the nucleus, and UV treatment did not alter this localization. We also used yeast two-hybrid analysis to examine the interaction of AtRAD4 with Arabidopsis RAD23 and found that RAD4 interacted with RAD23B as well as with the structurally similar protein HEMERA (HMR). In addition, we found that hmr and rad23 mutants exhibited increased UV sensitivity. Thus, our analysis suggests a role for RAD4 and RAD23/HMR in plant UV tolerance.",

One key component of the degradation system, the anaphase promoting complex (APC), is a ubiquitin protein ligase. It is activated both during mitosis and late in mitosis/G(1), by the WD repeat proteins Cdc20 and Cdh1, respectively. These activators target distinct sets of substrates. Cdc20-APC requires a well-defined destruction box (D box), whereas Cdh1-APC confers a different and as yet unidentified specificity. We have determined the sequence specificity for Cdh1-APC using two assays, ubiquitination in a completely defined and purified system and degradation promoted by Cdh1-APC in Xenopus extracts. Cdc20 is itself a Cdh1-APC substrate. Vertebrate Cdc20 lacks a D box and therefore is recognized by Cdh1-APC through a different sequence. By analysis of Cdc20 as a substrate, we have identified a new recognition signal. This signal, composed of K-E-N, serves as a general targeting signal for Cdh1-APC. Like the D box, it is transposable to other proteins. Using the KEN box as a template, we have identified cell cycle genes Nek2 and B99 as additional Cdh1-APC substrates.

Here we showed that ISG15 modification (ISGylation) of PCNA plays a key role in TLS termination. Upon UV irradiation, EFP, an ISG15 E3 ligase, bound to mono-ubiquitinated PCNA and promoted its ISGylation. ISGylated PCNA then tethered USP10 for deubiquitination and in turn the release of polymerase-eta from PCNA. Eventually, PCNA was deISGylated by UBP43 for reloading of replicative DNA polymerases and resuming normal DNA replication. However, ISGylation-defective Lys-to-Arg mutations in PCNA or knockdown of any of ISG15, EFP, or USP10 led to persistent recruitment of mono-ubiquitinated PCNA and polymerase-eta to nuclear foci, causing an increase in mutation frequency. These findings establish a crucial role of PCNA ISGylation in termination of error-prone TLS for preventing excessive mutagenesis.",

    "text": "Crystal structure of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 and its functional implications.  Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (PDP1) catalyzes dephosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) in the mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), whose activity is regulated by the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle by the corresponding protein kinases (PDHKs) and phosphatases. The activity of PDP1 is greatly enhanced through Ca2+ -dependent binding of the catalytic subunit (PDP1c) to the L2 (inner lipoyl) domain of dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2), which is also integrated in PDC. Here, we report the crystal structure of the rat PDP1c at 1.8 A resolution. The structure reveals that PDP1 belongs to the PPM family of protein serine/threonine phosphatases, which, in spite of a low level of sequence identity, share the structural core consisting of the central beta-sandwich flanked on both sides by loops and alpha-helices. Consistent with the previous studies, two well-fixed magnesium ions are coordinated by five active site residues and five water molecules in the PDP1c catalytic center. Structural analysis indicates that, while the central portion of the PDP1c molecule is highly conserved among the members of the PPM protein family, a number of structural insertions and deletions located at the periphery of PDP1c likely define its functional specificity towards the PDC. One notable feature of PDP1c is a long insertion (residues 98-151) forming a unique hydrophobic pocket on the surface that likely accommodates the lipoyl moiety of the E2 domain in a fashion similar to that of PDHKs. The cavity, however, appears more open than in PDHK, suggesting that its closure may be required to achieve tight, specific binding of the lipoic acid. We propose a mechanism in which the closure of the lipoic acid binding site is triggered by the formation of the intermolecular (PDP1c/L2) Ca2+ binding site in a manner reminiscent of the Ca2+ -induced closure of the regulatory domain of troponin C.",

    "text": "Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy experiments show that a significant percentage of structures labeled with endogenous AP-1, AP-3 and BLOC-2 co-localize with endogenous Rab32 and Rab38 in many locations throughout MNT-1 melanocytes. A larger percentage of structures labeled by AP-1, AP-3 or BLOC-2 co-localize with Rab38 than with Rab32. This is consistent with the stronger membrane association defects observed with Rab38 compared with Rab32 upon depletion of AP-3 and BLOC-2. The localization of Rab32 and Rab38 is likely to specific tubular domains of early/recycling endosomes that contain AP-1, AP-3 or BLOC-2. In support of that idea, Rab32 and Rab38 do not colocalize with the early endosome vacuolar domain marker EEA1 or tubular domains involved in the retrieval pathway to the trans-Golgi network labeled by the retromer complex. Interestingly, both Rab38 and Rab32 partially co-localize with the coat protein clathrin. Upon vesicle budding, the clathrin coat and adaptors disassemble and return to the cytosolic pool so they can be reutilized in further rounds of traffic (Fig. 1). Therefore, Rab32 and Rab38 are probably loaded onto the transport vesicles on endosomal tubular domains during the budding process or soon after vesicle release, but before vesicle uncoating. Rab32 and Rab38 likely remain bound to vesicles upon disassembly of AP-1, AP-3 and clathrin from vesicles (Fig. 1). It has been suggested that BLOC-2 may also be present in downstream vesicles or transport intermediates and may not undergo quick dissociation as is expected for AP-1, AP-3 and clathrin. This possibility would be consistent with the stronger Rab38-BLOC-2 membrane association described above. Rabs are ideal candidates to serve as mediators of trafficking between endosomal tubules and downstream organelles through interactions with specific effector proteins. The specificity of Rab32 and Rab38 function in endosome to melanosome trafficking is demonstrated by their localization to stage III and IV melanosomes and not to lysosomes (Fig. 1). These results indicate that Rab32 and Rab38 operate in the same pathways previously defined for AP-1, AP-3 and BLOC-2 and suggest they are the specific proteins that divert AP-1, AP-3 and BLOC-2-dependent cargoes to maturing melanosomes and away from lysosomes.",

The role of PKN, a fatty acid- and Rho small GTPase-activated protein kinase, in cell-cycle regulation was analyzed. Microinjection of the active form of PKN into a Xenopus embryo caused cleavage arrest, whereas normal cell division proceeded in the control embryo microinjected with buffer or the inactive form of PKN. Exogenous addition of the active form of PKN delayed mitotic timing in Xenopus egg cycling extracts judging by morphology of sperm nuclei and Cdc2/cyclin B histone H1 kinase activity. The kinase-negative form of PKN did not affect the timing, suggesting that delayed mitotic timing depends on the kinase activity of PKN. The dephosphorylation of Tyr-15 of Cdc2 was also delayed in correlation with Cdc2/cyclin B histone H1 kinase activation in extracts containing active PKN. The Cdc25C activity for the dephosphorylation of Tyr-15 in Cdc2 was suppressed by pretreatment with the active form of PKN. Furthermore, PKN efficiently phosphorylated Cdc25C in vitro, indicating that PKN directly inhibits Cdc25C activity by phosphorylation. These results suggest that PKN plays a significant role in the control of mitotic timing by inhibition of Cdc25C.",

The structural basis for this key distinction among SM protein families can be understood by superimposing domain 1 of Vps33 upon that of other, N-peptide-binding SM proteins. This analysis reveals that the binding site normally occupied by the N-peptide's conserved Arg side chain (Fig. 5A) is, uniquely in the case of Vps33, filled by Arg-115 of the SM protein itself (Fig. 5B). The positioning of the Arg-115 side chain is reinforced by a salt-bridge formed with Asp-120. Also blocked - and only in Vps33- is the pocket that normally accommodates a conserved hydrophobic residue located four residues C-terminal to the N-peptide Arg residue (Fig. 5C,D). In this case a displacement of the Vps33 backbone, relative to other SM proteins, causes the side chain of Leu-129 to occupy the binding pocket. Thus, both of the pockets that in other SM proteins accommodate conserved Qa-SNARE N-peptide residues are missing in Vps33. Likewise, the N-terminal region of the relevant Qa-SNARE Vam3 lacks the sequence determinants - including the conserved Arg - found in the N-peptides of the Qa-SNAREs that bind SM proteins.",

Using a proteomics approach, we have identified a complex comprised of Shoc2/Sur-8 and the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) as a highly specific M-Ras effector. M-Ras targets Shoc2-PP1c to stimulate Raf activity by dephosphorylating the S259 inhibitory site of Raf proteins bound to other molecules of M-Ras or Ras. Therefore, distinct RFGs, through independent effectors, can regulate different steps in the activation of Raf kinases. Shoc2 function is essential for activation of the MAPK pathway by growth factors. Furthermore, in tumor cells with Ras gene mutations, inhibition of Shoc2 expression inhibits MAPK, but not PI3K activity. We propose that the Shoc2-PP1c holoenzyme provides an attractive therapeutic target for inhibition of the MAPK pathway in cancer.",

Despite their ability to deliver DnaB to the chromosomal origin to form the prepriming complex, this intermediate is inactive. Quantitative analysis of the prepriming complex suggests that the DnaB-DnaC complex contains three DnaC monomers per DnaB hexamer and that the interaction of primase with DnaB and primer formation triggers the release of DnaC, but not the mutants, from DnaB.

AML1 encodes transcription factors, which play a pivotal role in hematopoietic differentiation, and their inappropriate expression is associated with leukemic transformation of hematopoietic cells. Previous studies demonstrated that the transcription cofactor p300 binds to the C-terminal region of AML1 and stimulates AML1-dependent transcription during myeloid cell differentiation. Here, we report that AML1 is specifically acetylated by p300 in vitro. Mutagenesis analyses reveal that p300 acetylates AML1 at the two conserved lysine residues (Lys-24 and Lys-43). AML1 is subject to acetylation at the same sites in vivo, and p300-mediated acetylation significantly augments the DNA binding activity of AML1. Disruption of these two lysines severely impairs DNA binding of AML1 and reduced the transcriptional activity and the transforming potential of AML1. Taken together, these data indicate that acetylation of AML1 through p300 is a critical manner of posttranslational modification and identify a novel mechanism for regulating the function of AML1.",

    "text": "A modulator of rho family G proteins, rhoGDI, binds these G proteins via an immunoglobulin-like domain and a flexible N-terminal arm.  \nBACKGROUND: The rho family of small G proteins, including rho, rac and cdc42, are involved in many cellular processes, including cell transformation by ras and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Additionally, rac has a role in the regulation of phagocyte NADPH oxidase. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) of the rhoGDI family bind to these G proteins and regulate their activity by preventing nucleotide dissociation and by controlling their interaction with membranes. RESULTS: We report the structure of rhoGDI, determined by a combination of X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy and selective proteolysis show that the N-terminal 50-60 residues of rhoGDI are flexible and unstructured in solution. The 2.5 A crystal structure of the folded core of rhoGDI, comprising residues 59-204, shows it to have an immunoglobulin-like fold, with an unprecedented insertion of two short beta strands and a 310 helix. There is an unusual pocket between the beta sheets of the immunoglobulin fold which may bind the C-terminal isoprenyl group of rac. NMR spectroscopy shows that the N-terminal arm is necessary for binding rac, although it remains largely flexible even in the complex. CONCLUSIONS: The rhoGDI structure is notable for the existence of both a structured and a highly flexible domain, both of which appear to be required for the interaction with rac. The immunoglobulin-like fold of the structured domain is unusual for a cytoplasmic protein. The presence of equivalent cleavage sites in rhoGDI and the closely related D4/Ly-GDI (rhoGDI-2) suggest that proteolytic cleavage between the flexible and structured regions of rhoGDI may have a role in the regulation of the activity of members of this family. There is no detectable similarity between the structure of rhoGDI and the recently reported structure of rabGDI, which performs the same function as rhoGDI for the rab family of small G proteins.",

    "text": "To analyze cadherin-23/harmonin interactions, we produced the entire cytoplasmic regions of both cadherin-23 isoforms (CDH23 + exon68 and CDH23Deltaexon68) and the full-length harmonin-a isoform. We determined the harmonin-a concentration dependence of the steady-state binding signal to either CDH23 + exon68 or CDH23Deltaexon68 using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were very similar for both CDH23 isoforms (Table 1), which argues against exon 68 playing a significant role in harmonin binding. Surprisingly, these Kd values (97 +/- 14 and 79 +/- 11 nm) are much lower than those reported for the interaction of single PDZ domains with their binding partners. Because such a high-affinity cadherin-23/harmonin-a interaction could result from the involvement of several harmonin-a domains, we studied the interactions of truncated forms of harmonin-a with CDH23. No binding signal could be detected for either the Nter or the PDZ3 domains alone--proper folding of both truncated proteins was checked by circular dichroism experiments--at the highest concentration used (500 nm), which indicates that the corresponding Kd values are higher than 5 microm. This value is consistent with the previously reported Kd (25 microm) of the complex between Nter and a 20-residue CDH23 peptide. In contrast, the affinities of the Nter-PDZ1 fragment for the two CDH23 isoforms were similar to those of the full-length harmonin-a, while those of the Nter-PDZ1-PDZ2 fragment were only 1.5-1.9 times higher (Table 1). We deleted the C-terminal consensus PDZ-binding motif (ITEL) in both CDH23 isoforms and studied the binding of these DeltaITEL fragments to harmonin-a, Nter-PDZ1-PDZ2 and Nter-PDZ1. The Kd values for the DeltaITEL fragments were similar to those for the entire CDH23 isoforms, showing that the ITEL motif of CDH23 does not play an important role in the strengthening of the cadherin-23/harmonin-a complex (Table 1). This result, combined with the unusually low Kd values we measured, suggests that the binding mechanism between harmonin-a and cadherin-23 is non-canonical. Accordingly, the defective mechanoelectrical transduction resulting from the missense mutation that has been introduced in the PDZ2 domain of murine harmonin (harmonin-PDZ2AAA allele) and predicted to disrupt the binding to the ITEL motif of cadherin-23 is in fact more likely to be explained by the abnormal interaction between harmonin and other proteins containing a consensus PDZ-binding motif, which may include protocadherin-15.",

    "text": "Histone arginine methylation keeps RUNX1 target genes in an intermediate state.  The coordinated recruitment of epigenetic regulators of gene expression by transcription factors such as RUNX1 (AML1, acute myeloid leukemia 1) is crucial for hematopoietic differentiation. Here, we identify protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) as a central functional component of a RUNX1 corepressor complex containing Sin3a and HDAC1 in human hematopoietic progenitor cells. PRMT6 is recruited by RUNX1 and mediates asymmetric histone H3 arginine-2 dimethylation (H3R2me2a) at megakaryocytic genes in progenitor cells. H3R2me2a keeps RUNX1 target genes in an intermediate state with concomitant H3K27me3 and H3K4me2 but not H3K4me3. Upon megakaryocytic differentiation PRMT6 binding is lost, the H3R2me2a mark decreases and a coactivator complex containing WDR5/MLL and p300/pCAF is recruited. This leads to an increase of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac, which result in augmented gene expression. Our results provide novel mechanistic insight into how RUNX1 activity in hematopoietic progenitor cells maintains differentiation genes in a suppressed state but poised for rapid transcriptional activation.",

    "text": "Distinct BIR domains of cIAP1 mediate binding to and ubiquitination of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 and second mitochondrial activator of caspases.  Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) regulate apoptosis primarily by inhibiting caspase-family proteases. However, many IAPs also possess E3 ligase (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase) activities implicated in both caspase-dependent and -independent functions of these proteins. Here, we compared the structural features of cIAP1 responsible for its interactions with two known target proteins, TRAF2 and SMAC. The N-terminal (BIR1) and C-terminal (BIR3) BIR domains of cIAP1 were determined to be necessary and sufficient for binding TRAF2 and SMAC, respectively. Mutational analysis of the BIR1 and BIR3 domains identified critical residues required for TRAF2 and SMAC binding. Using these mutants, cIAP1-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF2 and SMAC in vitro was determined to be correspondingly dependent on intact binding sites on BIR1 and BIR3. Because TRAF2 regulates NF-kappaB activation, the effects of cIAP1 on TRAF2-mediated induction of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity were studied using reporter gene assays. Expression of a fragment of cIAP1 encompassing the three BIR domains (but not full-length cIAP1) greatly enhanced TRAF2-induced increases in NF-kappaB activity, providing a convenient assay for monitoring BIR-dependent effects of cIAP1 on TRAF2 in cells. BIR1 mutants of the BIR1-3 fragment of cIAP1 that failed to bind TRAF2 lost the ability to modulate NF-kappaB activity, demonstrating a requirement for BIR1-mediated interactions with TRAF2. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the modularity and diversification of BIR domains, showing that a single cIAP can direct its E3 ligase activity toward different substrates and can alter the cellular functions of different protein targets in accordance with differences in the specificity of individual BIR domains.",

Likewise, we could not retrieve HOT1 after a POT1-IP, which is in agreement with several other studies that searched for shelterin-associated factors either by immunoprecipitation or by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Our comparison of the cocrystal structures of telomeric DNA with the HOT1, TRF1 and TRF2 homeodomains indicates that while HOT1 is shifted 'down' in 5'-->3' direction by one base towards the following telomeric repeat, the binding sites are largely overlapping. Hence, it is intriguing how these proteins coexist at telomeres, how they compete for binding sites and whether the shelterin proteins are found interspersed on telomeres or whether there are discrete, mutually exclusive patches along the telomeric tracts. This might further contribute to answering the question how HOT1 is selectively restricted to a subset of telomeres.",

Ubiquitination of cytokine receptors controls intracellular receptor routing and signal duration, but the underlying molecular determinants are unclear. The suppressor of cytokine signaling protein SOCS3 drives lysosomal degradation of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR), depending on SOCS3-mediated ubiquitination of a specific lysine located in a conserved juxtamembrane motif. Here, we show that, despite ubiquitination of other lysines, positioning of a lysine within the membrane-proximal region is indispensable for this process. Neither reallocation of the motif nor fusion of ubiquitin to the C-terminus of the G-CSFR could drive lysosomal routing. However, within this region, the lysine could be shifted 12 amino acids toward the C-terminus without losing its function, arguing against the existence of a linear sorting motif and demonstrating that positioning of the lysine relative to the SOCS3 docking site is flexible. G-CSFR ubiquitination peaked after endocytosis, was inhibited by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin as well as hyperosmotic sucrose and severely reduced in internalization-defective G-CSFR mutants, indicating that ubiquitination mainly occurs at endosomes. Apart from elucidating structural and spatio-temporal aspects of SOCS3-mediated ubiquitination, these findings have implications for the abnormal signaling function of G-CSFR mutants found in severe congenital neutropenia, a hematopoietic disorder with a high leukemia risk.",

We recently identified the liver X receptor-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase inducible degrader of the LDL receptor (IDOL) as a modulator of lipoprotein metabolism. Acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, IDOL triggers ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). We demonstrate here that this outcome requires the conserved FERM and RING domains present in IDOL. The RING domain promotes ubiquitination in vitro and Lys-63-specific ubiquitination of the LDLR in vivo in response to IDOL or liver X receptor activation. We further identify RING residues that differentially influence ubiquitination of the LDLR or stability of IDOL. The FERM domain interacts with the LDLR and in living cells co-localizes with the receptor at the plasma membrane. Homology modeling revealed a phosphotyrosine-binding element embedded in the FERM domain. Mutating residues within this region or residues in the LDLR preceding the NPVY endocytosis motif abrogate LDLR degradation by IDOL. Collectively, our results indicate that both the FERM and RING domains are required for promoting lysosomal degradation of the LDLR by IDOL. Our findings may facilitate development of structure-based IDOL inhibitors aimed at increasing LDLR abundance in therapeutic strategies to treat cardiovascular disease.",

    "text": "dHIP14-dependent palmitoylation promotes secretion of the BMP antagonist Sog. \nAnalysis of diverse signaling systems has revealed that one important level of control is regulation of membrane trafficking of ligands and receptors. The activities of some ligands are also regulated by whether they are membrane bound or secreted. In Drosophila, several morphogenetic signals that play critical roles in development have been found to be subject to such regulation. For example, activity of the Hedgehog (Hh) is regulated by Raspberry, which palmitoylates Hh. Similarly, the palmitoylases Porcupine and Raspberry increase the activities of Wingless (Wg) and the EGF-ligand Spitz (Spi), respectively. In contrast to its vertebrate homologues, which have typical N-terminal signal sequences, the precursor form of Drosophila Hh contains an internal type-II secretory signal motif. The Short Gastrulation (Sog) protein is another secreted Drosophila protein that contains a type-II signal and differs from its vertebrate ortholog Chordin which contains a standard signal peptide. In this study, we examine the regulation of Sog secretion and regulation by dHIP14, the ortholog of a mammalian palmitoylase first identified as Huntington Interacting Protein (HIP). We show that dHIP14 binds to Sog and that Sog is palmitoylated. In S2 cells, dHIP14 promotes secretion of Sog as well as stabilizing a membrane associated form of Sog. We examined the requirement for candidate cysteine residues in the N-terminal predicted cytoplasmic domain of Sog and find that Cys27, one of two adjacent cysteines (Cys27 and Cys28), is essential for the full activity of dHIP14 and its effect on Sog. Finally, we find that dHIP14 promotes the activity of Sog in vivo. These studies highlight the growing importance of lipid modification in regulating signaling at the level of ligand production and localization.",

In response to the sterol depletion, the N-terminal segment of the precursor, which contains a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper domain, is released by two sequential cleavages and is translocated to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of target genes. The data herein show that released SREBP-2 uses a distinct nuclear transport pathway, which is mediated by importin beta. The mature form of SREBP-2 is actively transported into the nucleus when injected into the cell cytoplasm. SREBP-2 binds directly to importin beta in the absence of importin alpha. Ran-GTP but not Ran-GDP causes the dissociation of the SREBP-2-importin beta complex. G19VRan-GTP inhibits the nuclear import of SREBP-2 in living cells. In the permeabilized cell in vitro transport system, nuclear import of SREBP-2 is reconstituted only by importin beta in conjunction with Ran and its interacting protein p10/NTF2. We further demonstrate that the helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper motif of SREBP-2 contains a novel type of nuclear localization signal, which binds directly to importin beta.",

Covalent modification of many transcription factors with SUMO-1 is emerging as a key role of trans-activational regulation. Here, we demonstrate that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma, which is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor, is modified by SUMO-1. Sumoylation of PPARgamma mainly occurs at a lysine residue within the activation function 1 domain. Furthermore, we show that the PIAS family proteins, PIAS1 and PIASxbeta, function as E3 ligases (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase) for PPARgamma. PPARgamma interacts directly with PIASxbeta in a ligand-independent manner. Analysis using a PPARgamma mutant with a disrupted sumoylation site shows that modification of PPARgamma by SUMO-1 represses its transcriptional activity. Interestingly, PIASxbeta and Ubc9 enhance the transcriptional activity of PPARgamma independent of PPARgamma sumoylation. Furthermore, PPARgamma ligand-induced apoptosis in a human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, is significantly enhanced by ectopic production of the sumoylation-mutant PPARgamma. These results suggest that the PPARgamma-dependent transactivation pathway seems to be modulated by SUMO-1 modification and may serve as a novel target for apoptosis-induction therapy in cancer cells.",

Accessory proteins known as recombination mediators are required for the formation of the active presynaptic filament. One such mediator in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is the Swi5-Sfr1 complex, which has been identified as an activator of Rad51 that assists in presynaptic filament formation and stimulates its strand exchange reaction. Here, we determined the 1:1 binding stoichiometry between the two subunits of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex using analytical ultracentrifugation and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments revealed that the Swi5-Sfr1 complex displays an extremely elongated dogleg-shaped structure in solution, which is consistent with its exceptionally high frictional ratio (f/f(0)) of 2.0 +/- 0.2 obtained by analytical ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, we determined a rough topology of the complex by comparing the small-angle x-ray scattering-based structures of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex and four Swi5-Sfr1-Fab complexes, in which the Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies were specifically bound to experimentally determined sites of Sfr1. We propose a model for how the Swi5-Sfr1 complex binds to the Rad51 filament, in which the Swi5-Sfr1 complex fits into the groove of the Rad51 filament, leading to an active and stable presynaptic filament.",

Wnt receptor complexes contain a member of the Frizzled family of serpentine receptors and a co-receptor, which commonly is a single-pass transmembrane protein. Vertebrate protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) was identified as a Wnt co-receptor required for control of planar cell polarity (PCP) in frogs and mice. We found that flies homozygous for a complete knock-out of the Drosophila PTK7 homolog off track (otk) are viable and fertile and do not show PCP phenotypes. We discovered an otk paralog (otk2, CG8964), which is co-expressed with otk throughout embryonic and larval development. Otk and Otk2 bind to each other and form complexes with Frizzled, Frizzled2 and Wnt2, pointing to a function as Wnt co-receptors. Flies lacking both otk and otk2 are viable but male sterile due to defective morphogenesis of the ejaculatory duct. Overexpression of Otk causes female sterility due to malformation of the oviduct, indicating that Otk and Otk2 are specifically involved in the sexually dimorphic development of the genital tract.",

However, the exact regulatory function of these modifications in vivo remains elusive. Here we show that RNF111 is required for efficient repair of ultraviolet-induced DNA lesions.

Our data suggest that RNF111, together with the CRL4(DDB2) ubiquitin ligase complex, is responsible for sequential XPC ubiquitylation, which regulates the recruitment and release of XPC and is crucial for efficient progression of the NER reaction, thereby providing an extra layer of quality control of NER.",

Its stability is essential for proper cell-cycle progression and cell fate decision. Ubiquitylation by the multiple E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes is the major regulatory mechanism of p21, which induces p21 degradation. However, it is unclear whether ubiquitylated p21 can be recycled. In this study, we report USP11 as a deubiquitylase of p21. In the nucleus, USP11 binds to p21, catalyzes the removal of polyubiquitin chains conjugated onto p21, and stabilizes p21 protein. As a result, USP11 reverses p21 polyubiquitylation and degradation mediated by SCFSKP2, CRL4CDT2, and APC/CCDC20 in a cell-cycle-independent manner. Loss of USP11 causes the destabilization of p21 and induces the G1/S transition in unperturbed cells. Furthermore, p21 accumulation mediated by DNA damage is completely abolished in cells depleted of USP11, which results in abrogation of the G2 checkpoint and induction of apoptosis. Functionally, USP11-mediated stabilization of p21 inhibits cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vivo. These findings reveal an important mechanism by which p21 can be stabilized by direct deubiquitylation, and they pinpoint a crucial role of the USP11-p21 axis in regulating cell-cycle progression and DNA damage responses.",

However, the role of menin in tumorigenesis and its physiological functions are not known. Here, we show that menin inactivation by antisense RNA antagonizes transforming growth factor type beta-mediated cell growth inhibition. Menin interacts with Smad3, and antisense menin suppresses transforming growth factor type beta-induced and Smad3-induced transcriptional activity by inhibiting Smad3/4-DNA binding at specific transcriptional regulatory sites. These results implicate a mechanism of tumorigenesis by menin inactivation.",

One of the endothelial-associated ligands for L-selectin is GlyCAM-1, a mucin-like glycoprotein, which presents novel sulfated, sialylated and fucosylated O-glycans. In order to understand the generation of these glycans, we have examined the biosynthesis of GlyCAM-1 in lymph node organ culture. Using peptide-specific antibodies, lectins, and recombinant L-selectin, we detected the following species of GlyCAM-1: unglycosylated (< 28 kDa); modified with GalNAc only (28-33 kDa); modified with sialic acid, fucose, and sulfate but lacking L-selectin reactivity (40-50 kDa); and mature (L-selectin-reactive) ligand (50-60 kDa). Pulse-chase labeling at 15 degrees C suggested that GalNAc is added in a pre-Golgi compartment. Treatment with brefeldin A almost completely blocked sulfation, indicating that this modification occurs in the trans-Golgi network. Two distinct sialylation events occurred in the presence of brefeldin A, while fucosylation was partially blocked. We conclude that sialylation precedes both fucosylation and sulfation during biosynthesis. This ordering will help to identify the critical acceptor structures recognized by lymph node glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases.",

We also show that all BBSome subunits and BBS3 (also known as ARL6) are required for BBSome ciliary entry and that reduction of LZTFL1 restores BBSome trafficking to cilia in BBS3 and BBS5 depleted cells. Finally, we found that BBS proteins and LZTFL1 regulate ciliary trafficking of hedgehog signal transducer, Smoothened.

These proteins contain a C-terminal farnesyl-cysteine alpha-methyl ester and palmitoyl groups attached to nearby cysteines. Data is presented showing that rat liver microsomes contain an enzyme that transfers the palmitoyl group from palmitoyl-coenzyme A to cysteine residues of H-Ras protein and of a synthetic peptide having the structure of the C terminus of N-Ras. This protein palmitoyltransferase (PPT) was solubilized from membranes and purified 10,500-fold to apparent homogeneity with an overall yield of 10%. On an SDS gel, PPT appears as two proteins of molecular masses of approximately 30 and approximately 33 kDa. If the palmitoylation sites of the N-Ras peptide (the non-farnesylated cysteine) or H-Ras protein (cysteines 181 and 184) are changed to serine, palmitoylation by PPT does not occur. Non-farnesylated H-Ras produced in bacteria as well as in vitro farnesylated bacterial H-Ras are not substrates for PPT nor is the non-farnesylated, methylated N-Ras peptide. These results suggest, but do not prove, that farnesylation and possibly C-terminal methylation are prerequisites for Ras palmitoylation. PPT shows a large preference for palmitoyl-coenzyme A over myristoyl-coenzyme as the acyl donor. Values of Km for palmitoyl-CoA and H-Ras are 4.3 +/- 1.2 and 0.8 +/- 0.3 microM, respectively. PPT is the first protein palmitoyltransferase to be purified, and the availability of pure enzyme should contribute to our understanding of the function and regulation of Ras palmitoylation in cells.",

A particular form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) containing a B55delta subunit (PP2A- B55delta) is the major protein phosphatase that acts on model CDK substrates in Xenopus egg extracts and has antimitotic activity. The activity of PP2A-B55delta is high in interphase and low in mitosis, exactly opposite that of Cdk1. We report that inhibition of PP2A-B55delta results from a small protein, known as alpha-endosulfine (Ensa), that is phosphorylated in mitosis by the protein kinase Greatwall (Gwl). This converts Ensa into a potent and specific inhibitor of PP2A-B55delta. This pathway represents a previously unknown element in the control of mitosis.",

We screened a short hairpin library targeting members of the deubiquitination enzyme family and identified the X-linked deubiquitination enzyme USP26 as a novel regulator of AR signaling. USP26 is a nuclear protein that binds to AR via three important nuclear receptor interaction motifs, and modulates AR ubiquitination, consequently influencing AR activity and stability.

Hedgehog signalling is crucial for the physiological maintenance and self-renewal of neural stem cells and its deregulation is responsible for their progression towards tumorigenesis. The mechanisms that inhibit this pathway during the differentiation stage are poorly understood. Here, we identify Numb as a Hedgehog-pathway inhibitor that is downregulated in early GCPs and GCP-derived cancer cells. We demonstrate that the Hedgehog transcription factor Gli1 is targeted by Numb for Itch-dependent ubiquitination, which suppresses Hedgehog signals, thus arresting growth and promoting cell differentiation. This novel Numb-dependent regulatory loop may limit the extent and duration of Hedgehog signalling during neural-progenitor differentiation, and its subversion may be a relevant event in brain tumorigenesis.",

Translational repression prior to localization of the transcript is mediated, in part, by the Bruno protein, which binds to discrete sites in the 3' untranslated region of the oskar mRNA. To begin to understand how Bruno acts in translational repression, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify Bruno-interacting proteins. One interactor, described here, is the product of the apontic gene. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments lend biochemical support to the idea that Bruno and Apontic proteins physically interact in Drosophila. Genetic experiments using mutants defective in apontic and bruno reveal a functional interaction between these genes. Given this interaction, Apontic is likely to act together with Bruno in translational repression of oskar mRNA. Interestingly, Apontic, like Bruno, is an RNA-binding protein and specifically binds certain regions of the oskar mRNA 3' untranslated region.",

During osteogenesis, total HDAC enzymatic activity was decreased with significant reduction in HDAC1 expression. Consistently, recruitment of HDAC1 to the promoters of osteoblast marker genes, including osterix and osteocalcin, was down-regulated, whereas histone H3 and H4 were hyperacetylated at those promoters during osteoblast differentiation. Moreover, suppression of HDAC activity with a HDAC inhibitor, sodium butyrate, accelerated osteogenesis by inducing osteoblast marker genes including osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase.

In a screen for proteins interacting with MASH1, we have isolated a novel bHLH protein related to atonal, named MATH4A, which is broadly expressed in neural precursor cells in the mouse embryonic CNS and PNS. Interaction assays in yeast and in vitro demonstrate that MATH4A interacts efficiently with both MASH1 and the ubiquitous bHLH protein E12. MATH4A-E12 heterodimers, but not MATH4A-MASH1, bind to a consensus E-box sequence. Math4A expression is restricted to undifferentiated neural precursors and is complementary to that of Mash1 in most regions of the nervous system. In particular, Math4A is transcribed at high levels in the cerebral cortex, dorsal thalamus, and epibranchial placodes, which present little or no Mash1 expression. However, expression of the two genes shows limited overlap in certain CNS regions (retina, preoptic area of the hypothalamus, midbrain, hindbrain). Its structure and expression pattern suggest that MATH4A may regulate an early step of neural development, either as a partner of ubiquitous bHLH proteins or associated with other neural-specific bHLH proteins.",

    "text": "Proper SUMO-1 conjugation is essential to DJ-1 to exert its full activities.  DJ-1 is a multifunctional protein that plays roles in transcriptional regulation and antioxidative stress, and loss of its function is thought to result in the onset of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we report that DJ-1 was sumoylated on a lysine residue at amino-acid number 130 (K130) by PIASxalpha or PIASy. The K130 mutation abrogated all of the functions of DJ-1, including ras-dependent transformation, cell growth promotion and anti-UV-induced apoptosis activities. Sumoylation of DJ-1 was increased after UV irradiation concomitant with a pI shift to an acidic point of DJ-1. Furthermore, L166P, a mutant DJ-1 found in PD patients, and K130RX, an artificial mutant containing four mutations in DJ-1, were improperly sumoylated, and they became insoluble, partly localized in the mitochondria and degraded by the proteasome system. Both L166P-expressing cells and DJ-1-knockdown cells were found to be highly susceptible to UV-induced cell apoptosis.",

    "text": "Identification of the substrate binding region of vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) using iodoaminoflisopolol as a novel photoprobe.  \nMonoamines, such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, are sequestered into synaptic vesicles by specific transporters (vesicular monoamine transporter-2; VMAT2) using energy from an electrochemical proton gradient across the vesicle membranes. Based on our previous studies using photoaffinity-labeling techniques in characterizing the VMAT2-specific ligands ketanserin and tetrabenazine, this study describes the synthesis and characterization of a fluorenone-based compound, iodoaminoflisopolol (IAmF), as a photoprobe to identify the substrate binding site(s) of VMAT2. Using vesicles prepared from rat VMAT2 containing recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, we show the inhibition of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) uptake and [3H]dihydrotetrabenazine (TBZOH) binding by aminoflisopolol and iodoaminoflisopolol. The interaction of [125I]IAmF with VMAT2 is highly dependent on the presence of ATP and an intact proton gradient. We report a simple and novel method to distinguish between a ligand and substrate using classic compounds such as [3H]5-HT and [3H]TBZOH by incubating the compound with the vesicles followed by washes with isotonic and hypotonic solutions. Using this method, we confirm the characterization of IAmF as a novel VMAT2 substrate. Sf9 vesicles expressing VMAT2 show reserpine- and tetrabenazine-protectable photolabeling by [125I]IAmF. [125I]IAmF photolabeling of recombinant VMAT2, expressed in SH-SY5Y cells with an engineered thrombin site between transmembranes 6 and 7, followed by thrombin digestion, retained photolabel in a 22-kDa fragment, indicating that iodoaminoflisopolol binds to the C-terminal half of the VMAT2 molecule. Thus, IAmF possesses a unique combination of VMAT2 substrate properties and a photoprobe and is, therefore, useful to identify the substrate binding site of the vesicular transporter.",

Moreover, homologues of all the subunits exist in multicellular eukaryotes and the essential role for the complex in growth and development is conserved as well.

This enzyme then activates PK to kallikrein. Further reciprocal activation of fXII by kallikrein, and PK by fXIIa, results in a positive feedback loop. The fXIIa that is generated then activates its downstream substrate, fXI, to fXIa (Figure 1). Limited proteolysis of fIX to fIXa by fXIa then allows for formation of the \"intrinsic tenase\" complex (i.e., the cell-surface complex of fIXa and fVIIIa), which in turn activates fX to fXa.

Previous studies suggest that WWP1 promotes cell proliferation and survival; however, the mechanism of WWP1 action is still poorly understood. Here, we showed that WWP1 upregulates and maintains erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2) and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) in multiple cell lines. WWP1 depletion dramatically attenuates the EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation. WWP1 forms a protein complex with RING finger protein 11 (RNF11), a negative regulator of ErbB2 and EGFR. The protein-protein interaction is through the first and third WW domains of WWP1 and the PY motif of RNF11. Although WWP1 is able to ubiquitinate RNF11 in vitro and in vivo, WWP1 neither targets RNF11 for degradation nor changes RNF11's cellular localization. Importantly, inhibition of RNF11 can rescue WWP1 siRNA-induced ErbB2 and EGFR downregulation and growth arrest. Finally, we demonstrated that RNF11 is overexpressed in a panel of prostate and breast cancer cell lines with WWP1 expression. These findings suggest that WWP1 may promote cell proliferation and survival partially through suppressing RNF11-mediated ErbB2 and EGFR downregulation.",

Thus, we propose that the presence of salt bridges in the yeast m1A58 Mtase (Trm61p-E255 and Trm6p-R420, and between Trm6p-E416 and Trm61p-R259), and most likely also in bacterial TrmI Mtases (e.g. E299-R233 in Rv2118c), serves to establish the structure of the tRNA-binding region rather than to promote binding of subunits to each other. We hypothesize that the mutations reported in this work could have long-range structural effects on the conformation of the positively charged loop (residues 265-345) in the Trm61p subunit, which may be involved in tRNA binding. By identifying amino acids involved in tRNA binding, this study has provided a foundation on which further studies can be built, such as experiments to address our hypothesis regarding tRNA binding and to determine how the yeast m1A58 Mtase is able to recognize substrate tRNAs amongst the cellular tRNA pool.",

Listeria monocytogenes surface proteins internalin (Inl)A and InlB interact with the junctional protein E-cadherin and the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor Met, respectively, on the surface of epithelial cells to mediate bacterial entry. Here we show that InlA triggers two successive E-cadherin post-translational modifications, i.e. the Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin followed by its ubiquitination by the ubiquitin-ligase Hakai. E-cadherin ubiquitination induces the recruitment of clathrin that is required for optimal bacterial internalization. We also show that the initial clustering of E-cadherin at the bacterial entry site requires caveolin, a protein normally involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis. Strikingly clathrin and caveolin are also recruited at the site of entry of E-cadherin-coated sepharose beads and functional experiments demonstrate that these two proteins are required for bead entry. Together these results not only document how the endocytosis machinery is recruited and involved in the internalization of a zippering bacterium, but also strongly suggest a functional link between E-cadherin endocytosis and the formation of adherens junctions in epithelial cells.",

Here, we show that the MLL2 complex associates with the hematopoietic activator NF-E2 in erythroid cells and is important for H3K4 trimethylation and maximal levels of transcription at the beta-globin locus. Furthermore, recruitment of the MLL2 complex to the beta-globin locus is dependent upon NF-E2 and coincides spatio-temporally with NF-E2 binding during erythroid differentiation. Thus, a DNA-bound activator is important initially for guiding MLL2 to a particular genomic location. Interestingly, while the MLL2-associated subunit ASH2L is restricted to the beta-globin locus control region 38 kb upstream of the beta(maj)-globin gene, the MLL2 protein spreads across the beta-globin locus, suggesting a previously undefined mechanism by which an activator influences transcription and H3K4 trimethylation at a distance.",

Because GATOR1 was reported to be present on the lysosomal membrane when overexpressed, and because Sestrin2 indirectly regulates the association between GATOR1 and RagB, it is possible that Sestrin2 changes the subcellular localization of GATOR1 through displacement of GATOR2. Indeed, although endogenous DEPDC5, a GATOR1 component, does not show significant lysosomal localization under normal culture conditions, a substantial amount of DEPDC5 accumulated on the lysosomal membrane when Sestrin2 was overexpressed (Fig. 4F, arrows). Overexpressed Sestrin2 itself was not co-localized with lysosomally-accumulated DEPDC5 (Fig. 4G).

Sumoylation activity requires p53-MDM2 binding but does not depend on an intact RING finger. Both ARF and L11 can promote SUMO-2/3 conjugation of p53. However, unlike the previously described SUMO-1 conjugation of p53 by an MDM2-ARF complex, this activity does not depend on the ability of MDM2 to relocalize to the nucleolus. Interestingly, the SUMO consensus is not conserved in mouse p53, which is therefore not modified by SUMO-2/3. Finally, we show that conjugation of SUMO-2/3 to p53 correlates with a reduction of both activation and repression of a subset of p53-target genes.",

    "text": "The association of BAG6 with SGTA and tail-anchored proteins.  \nThe BAG6 protein is a subunit of a heterotrimeric complex that binds a range of membrane and secretory protein precursors localized to the cytosol, enforcing quality control and influencing their subsequent fate. BAG6 has an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain, and a C-terminal Bcl-2-associated athanogene domain, separated by a large central proline-rich region. We have used in vitro binding approaches to identify regions of BAG6 important for its interactions with: i) the small-glutamine rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha (SGTA) and ii) two model tail-anchored membrane proteins as a paradigm for its hydrophobic substrates. We show that the BAG6-UBL is essential for binding to SGTA, and find that the UBL of a second subunit of the BAG6-complex, ubiquitin-like protein 4A (UBL4A), competes for SGTA binding. Our data show that this binding is selective, and suggest that SGTA can bind either BAG6, or UBL4A, but not both at the same time. We adapted our in vitro binding assay to study the association of BAG6 with an immobilized tail-anchored protein, Sec61Beta, and find both the UBL and BAG domains are dispensable for binding this substrate. This conclusion was further supported using a heterologous subcellular localization assay in yeast, where the BAG6-dependent nuclear relocalization of a second tail-anchored protein, GFP-Sed5, also required neither the UBL, nor the BAG domain of BAG6. On the basis of these findings, we propose a working model where the large central region of the BAG6 protein provides a binding site for a diverse group of substrates, many of which expose a hydrophobic stretch of polypeptide. This arrangement would enable the BAG6 complex to bring together its substrates with potential effectors including those recruited via its N-terminal UBL. Such effectors may include SGTA, and the resulting assemblies influence the subsequent fate of the hydrophobic BAG6 substrates.",

    "text": "Malin decreases glycogen accumulation by promoting the degradation of protein targeting to glycogen (PTG).  Lafora disease (LD) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease that results in progressive myoclonus epilepsy and death. LD is caused by mutations in either the E3 ubiquitin ligase malin or the dual specificity phosphatase laforin. A hallmark of LD is the accumulation of insoluble glycogen in the cytoplasm of cells from most tissues. Glycogen metabolism is regulated by phosphorylation of key metabolic enzymes. One regulator of this phosphorylation is protein targeting to glycogen (PTG/R5), a scaffold protein that binds both glycogen and many of the enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis, including protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, and laforin. Overexpression of PTG markedly increases glycogen accumulation, and decreased PTG expression decreases glycogen stores. To investigate if malin and laforin play a role in glycogen metabolism, we overexpressed PTG, malin, and laforin in tissue culture cells. We found that expression of malin or laforin decreased PTG-stimulated glycogen accumulation by 25%, and co-expression of malin and laforin abolished PTG-stimulated glycogen accumulation. Consistent with this result, we found that malin ubiquitinates PTG in a laforin-dependent manner, both in vivo and in vitro, and targets PTG for proteasome-dependent degradation. These results suggest an additional mechanism, involving laforin and malin, in regulating glycogen metabolism.",

We found that transformation by v-src virtually inhibited the SHPS-1 expression at mRNA level. While nontransforming Src kinases including c-Src, nonmyristoylated forms of v-Src had no inhibitory effect on SHPS-1 expression, transforming Src kinases including wild-type v-Src and chimeric mutant of c-Src bearing v-Src SH3 substantially suppressed the SHPS-1 expression. In cells expressing temperature sensitive mutant of v-Src, suppression of the SHPS-1 expression was temperature-dependent. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 was rather activated in cells expressing c-Src or nonmyristoylated forms of v-Src. SHPS-1 expression in SR3Y1 was restored by treatment with herbimycin A, a potent inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, or by the expression of dominant negative form of Ras. Contrary, active form of Mekl markedly suppressed SHPS-1 expression. Finally, overexpression of SHPS-1 in SR3Y1 led to the drastic reduction of anchorage independent growth of the cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the suppression of SHPS-1 expression is a pivotal event for cell transformation by v-src, and the Ras-MAP kinase cascade plays a critical role in the suppression.",

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96, 10194-10199, 1999). Here we show that BAG-1M binds and enhances transcriptional activity of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) early gene promoter under unstressed conditions. This activity is unique to BAG-1M in that other isoforms, BAG-1S and BAG-1L, are much weaker in this activity, although all of the isoforms share common ubiquitin-like domain and BAG domain interacting with Hsp70/Hsc70. Deletion analysis of BAG-1M showed that C-terminal BAG domain is necessary to enhance the CMV promoter activity, suggesting that interaction with Hsp70/Hsc70 proteins may mediate this function. Another mutation in N-terminus, BAG-1M K(2-4)A, lost DNA binding capacity and majority of the promoter-enhancing activity. Our study demonstrates that both N-terminal DNA binding site and C-terminal Hsp70/Hsc70 binding site of BAG-1M play an important role in enhancing the CMV promoter activity.",

In order to investigate this question, we examined whether the expression of the TMEM106B variants affected autophagic flux. In order to measure autophagic flux, the levels of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-II in cells expressing T185 or S185 in the presence or absence of the lysosomotrophic reagent ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) were quantified in a western blot analysis.

Recent studies have shown that ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha is carried out by a ubiquitin-ligase enzyme complex called SCF(beta(TrCP)). Here we show that Nedd8 modification of the Cul-1 component of SCF(beta(TrCP)) is important for function of SCF(beta(TrCP)) in ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha. In cells, Nedd8-conjugated Cul-1 was complexed with two substrates of SCF(beta(TrCP)), phosphorylated IkappaBalpha and beta-catenin, indicating that Nedd8-Cul-1 conjugates are part of SCF(beta(TrCP)) in vivo. Although only a minute fraction of total cellular Cul-1 is modified by Nedd8, the Cul-1 associated with ectopically expressed betaTrCP was highly enriched for the Nedd8-conjugated form. Moreover, optimal ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha required Nedd8 and the Nedd8-conjugating enzyme, Ubc12. The site of Nedd8 ligation to Cul-1 is essential, as SCF(beta(TrCP)) containing a K720R mutant of Cul-1 only weakly supported IkappaBalpha ubiquitination compared to SCF(beta(TrCP)) containing WT Cul-1, suggesting that the Nedd8 ligation of Cul-1 affects the ubiquitination activity of SCF(beta(TrCP)). These observations provide a functional link between the highly related ubiquitin and Nedd8 pathways of protein modification and show how they operate together to selectively target the signal-dependent degradation of IkappaBalpha.",

GSDMD processing by caspase-11 was unaffected by disulfiram, but processed GSDMD-NT did not cause liposome leakage if disulfiram was present.

Knowledge-based drug design led to the development of a pure PRLR antagonist (Del1-9-G129R-hPRL) that was recently shown to prevent PRL-induced mouse prostate tumorogenesis. In humans, the first gain-of-function mutation of the PRLR (PRLR(I146L)) was recently identified in breast tumor patients. At the molecular level, the actual mechanism of action of these two novel players in the PRL system remains elusive. In this study, we addressed whether constitutive PRLR activation (PRLR(I146L)) or PRLR blockade (antagonist) involved alteration of receptor oligomerization and/or of inter-chain distances compared to unstimulated and PRL-stimulated PRLR. Using a combination of various biochemical and spectroscopic approaches (co-IP, blue native electrophoresis, BRET(1)), we demonstrated that preformed PRLR homodimers are altered neither by PRL- or I146L-induced receptor triggering, nor by antagonist-mediated blockade. These findings were confirmed using a novel time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) technology that allows monitoring distance changes between cell surface tagged receptors. This technology revealed that PRLR blockade or activation did not involve detectable distance changes between extracellular domains of receptor chains within the dimer. This study merges with our previous structural investigations suggesting that the mechanism of PRLR activation solely involves intermolecular contact adaptations leading to subtle intramolecular rearrangements.",

The kinetic properties of the rat and chicken liver enzymes, purified to homogeneity after expression in E. coli, were different including negative cooperativity for ATP binding and inhibition by Mg2+ for the chicken liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase but not for the rat liver kinase. Differences in the beta-loop ATP signature sequences in the chicken and rat liver kinase domains may explain the kinetic differences and represent the major divergence in the evolution of the enzyme from birds to mammals.",

Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein plays a role in both transcription-coupled DNA repair and transcriptional regulation of all three classes of nuclear RNA polymerases. Here we show that a complex consisting of CSB, RNA polymerase I (Pol I), and histone methyltransferase G9a is present at active rRNA genes. G9a methylates histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me2) in the pre-rRNA coding region and facilitates the association of heterochromatin protein 1gamma (HP1gamma) with rDNA. Both H3K9 methylation and HP1gamma association require ongoing transcription. Knockdown of CSB prevents the association of Pol I with rDNA, impairs the interaction of G9a with Pol I, and inhibits pre-rRNA synthesis. Likewise, knockdown of G9a leads to decreased levels of H3K9me2 in the transcribed region and downregulation of pre-rRNA synthesis. The results reveal the mechanism underlying CSB-mediated activation of rDNA transcription and link G9a-dependent H3K9 methylation to Pol I transcription elongation through chromatin.",

This process requires a ubiquitin-like protein conjugation system, in which Apg12 is covalently bound to Apg5. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Apg12-Apg5 conjugate further interacts with a small coiled-coil protein, Apg16. The Apg12-Apg5 and Apg16 are localized in the cytosol and pre-autophagosomal structures and play an essential role in autophagosome formation. Here we show that the Apg12-Apg5 conjugate and Apg16 form a approximately 350-kDa complex in the cytosol. Because Apg16 was suggested to form a homo-oligomer, we generated an in vivo system that allowed us to control the oligomerization state of Apg16. With this system, we demonstrated that formation of the approximately 350-kDa complex and autophagic activity depended on the oligomerization state of Apg16. These results suggest that the Apg12-Apg5 conjugate and Apg16 form a multimeric complex mediated by the Apg16 homo-oligomer, and formation of the approximately 350-kDa complex is required for autophagy in yeast.",

Here we show that JMJD5 (now renamed KDM8), a JmjC family member, demethylates H3K36me2 and is required for cell cycle progression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays applied to human genome tiling arrays in conjunction with RNA microarray revealed that KDM8 occupies the coding region of cyclin A1 and directly regulates transcription. Mechanistic analyses showed that KDM8 functioned as a transcriptional activator by inhibiting HDAC recruitment via demethylation of H3K36me2, an epigenetic repressive mark. Tumor array experiments revealed KDM8 is overexpressed in several types of cancer. In addition, loss-of-function studies in MCF7 cells leads to cell cycle arrest.

    "text": "Acetylation and methylation in nuclear receptor gene activation.  Activation of hormone target genes requires chromatin remodeling and histone modifications. The properties of the two PRMT coactivators. PRMT1 and CARM1, are compared in Table I. One can envision many scenarios in which histone arginine methylation contributes to transcriptional regulation. For example, it could be analogous to histone H3 K4 methylation by Set9, which blocks the HDAC NuRD complex from association and simultaneously impairs Suv39 h 1-mediated methylation at K9 of H3 (H3-K9). As a result, H3 K4 methylation by Set9 potentiates transcriptional activation. Histone arginine methylation might also promote or antagonize other histone-modifying enzymes. It has been shown that PRMT1-methylated histone H4 becomes a better substrate for p300 and, conversely, the acetylated histones are poor substrates for methylation by PRMT1. As for CARM1, acetylation of multiple lysines within histone H3 facilitates arginine methylation of by CARM1. Since PRMT1 and CARM1 methylate H4 and H3 tails, respectively, and each contributes to activation of the nuclear receptor response, it implicates the \"histone code\" as the physical template of hormone signaling. However, it remains to be resolved whether p160 family coactivators simultaneously recruit CARM1 and PRMT1 to specific target genes, and the order of the series of modifications on individual histone tails in vivo. Time-course studies of [table: see text] cofactor recruitment by ChIPs will be necessary to decipher the modification patterns. Another useful approach to analyze the function of NR cofactors on target gene transcription is the chromatin-dependent in vitro transcription system. As increasing amounts of evidence indicate that one HAT can be acetylated by another HAT, or methylated by HMT, it would not be surprising that transcription factors and their coactivators are bona fide substrates for protein modification.",

Here, we identified liprin alpha1/PPFIA1, a cytoplasmic protein necessary for focal adhesion formation and axon guidance, as a novel interacting protein with ING4. ING4 and liprin alpha1 colocalized at lamellipodia in the vicinity of vinculin. Overexpressed ING4 suppressed cell spreading and cell migration. In contrast, overexpressed liprin alpha1 enhanced cell spreading and cell migration. Knockdown of endogenous ING4 with RNA interference induced cell motility, whereas knockdown of endogenous liprin alpha1 suppressed cell motility. ING4 also suppressed cell motility that was enhanced by liprin alpha1. However, ING4 did not further suppress cell motility when liprin alpha1 was suppressed with RNA interference, suggesting a functional and mechanistic interdependence between these proteins. In addition to its nuclear functions, cytoplasmic ING4 interacts with liprin alpha1 to regulate cell migration and, with its known antiangiogenic function, may prevent invasion and metastasis.",

    "text": "Molecular architecture of quartet MOZ/MORF histone acetyltransferase complexes.  The monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein MOZ and the related factor MORF form tetrameric complexes with ING5 (inhibitor of growth 5), EAF6 (Esa1-associated factor 6 ortholog), and the bromodomain-PHD finger protein BRPF1, -2, or -3. To gain new insights into the structure, function, and regulation of these complexes, we reconstituted them and performed various molecular analyses. We found that BRPF proteins bridge the association of MOZ and MORF with ING5 and EAF6. An N-terminal region of BRPF1 interacts with the acetyltransferases; the enhancer of polycomb (EPc) homology domain in the middle part binds to ING5 and EAF6. The association of BRPF1 with EAF6 is weak, but ING5 increases the affinity. These three proteins form a trimeric core that is conserved from Drosophila melanogaster to humans, although authentic orthologs of MOZ and MORF are absent in invertebrates. Deletion mapping studies revealed that the acetyltransferase domain of MOZ/MORF is sufficient for BRPF1 interaction. At the functional level, complex formation with BRPF1 and ING5 drastically stimulates the activity of the acetyltransferase domain in acetylation of nucleosomal histone H3 and free histones H3 and H4. An unstructured 18-residue region at the C-terminal end of the catalytic domain is required for BRPF1 interaction and may function as an \"activation lid.\" Furthermore, BRPF1 enhances the transcriptional potential of MOZ and a leukemic MOZ-TIF2 fusion protein. These findings thus indicate that BRPF proteins play a key role in assembling and activating MOZ/MORF acetyltransferase complexes.",

Whether Tim22p is required for the import of other membrane proteins besides carrier proteins is not known. Tim22p is proposed to be in a separate complex from Tim23p and Tim17p in the IM, but other members of this new complex have not been identified. We have identified a new protein, Tim54p, which is essential for the IM insertion of the Aac1 carrier and Tim23 import proteins. Tim54p is not required for the translocation of precursors across the IM into the matrix. We find that Tim54p physically interacts with Tim22p, and forms an import complex in the IM separate from the Tim23p-Tim17p import machinery. Our results indicate that there are two import pathways in the IM. One pathway uses Tim23p and Tim17p in the translocation of precursors across the IM, and the other requires Tim54p and Tim22p for the insertion of proteins into the IM. Because Tim54p and Tim22p are both essential for yeast cell viability, we suggest that the Tim54p-Tim22p complex plays a key role in the insertion of many, if not all, proteins into the IM.",

The factors determining such specificity in vivo have not been identified. In a mutational screen in Drosophila to identify Rac-specific signaling components, we isolated 11 alleles of myoblast city (mbc). mbc mutant embryos exhibit defects in dorsal closure, myogenesis, and neural development. DOCK180, the mammalian homolog of Mbc, associates with Rac, but not Cdc42, in a nucleotide-independent manner. These results suggest that Mbc is a specific upstream regulator of Rac activity that mediates several morphogenetic processes in Drosophila embryogenesis.",

In previous work, we developed one such tool, a system using the Arabidopsis flavoprotein cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) and its interacting partner CIB1 to inducibly control protein interactions with light. While these proteins do not interact in the dark, blue light absorption triggers a conformational change in CRY2 allowing binding to CIB1 that is reversible after several minutes (t(1/2) ~5.5 min). When attached to diverse target proteins, the CRY2 and CIB1 modules allow tight light regulation of target protein activity.",

The sulfation of the 3 tyrosine residues 276, 278, and 279 in GPIb alpha is an important posttranslational modification that seems to promote the interaction with VWF. The environment where sulfation of tyrosines occurs has been proposed to contain highly acidic residues. This investigation has examined the highly acidic region from Asp249 to Asp287 in the mature GPIb alpha protein. Changes to most of the carboxylic acids in this region resulted in decreased reactivity to VWF. Only 3 mutants (Glu270Gln, Asp283Asn, Asp283Asn/Glu285Gln/Asp287Asn) resulted in the abolition of sulfation. Two novel mutations were also created. First, a deletion of the 7 amino acids from Tyr276 to Glu282 led to a loss of sulfation and totally abolished VWF binding in the presence of botrocetin. This confirms that it is these 3 tyrosines that undergo sulfation and that this region is crucial for botrocetin-mediated VWF binding. The second mutation involves changing the lysine residues at 253, 258, and 262 to alanine. This also led to distinct changes in VWF binding and abolition of sulfation.",

    "text": "Human USP3 is a chromatin modifier required for S phase progression and genome stability.  Protein ubiquitination is critical for numerous cellular functions, including DNA damage response pathways. Histones are the most abundant monoubiquitin conjugates in mammalian cells; however, the regulation and the function of monoubiquitinated H2A (uH2A) and H2B (uH2B) remain poorly understood. In particular, little is known about mammalian deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that catalyze the removal of ubiquitin from uH2A/uH2B. Here we identify the ubiquitin-specific protease 3 USP3 as a deubiquitinating enzyme for uH2A and uH2B. USP3 dynamically associates with chromatin and deubiquitinates H2A/H2B in vivo. The ZnF-UBP domain of USP3 mediates uH2A-USP3 interaction. Functional ablation of USP3 by RNAi leads to delay of S phase progression and to accumulation of DNA breaks, with ensuing activation of DNA damage checkpoint pathways. In addition, we show that in response to ionizing radiation, (1) uH2A redistributes and colocalizes in gamma-H2AX DNA repair foci and (2) USP3 is required for full deubiquitination of ubiquitin-conjugates/uH2A and gamma-H2AX dephosphorylation. Our studies identify USP3 as a novel regulator of H2A and H2B ubiquitination, highlight its role in preventing replication stress, and suggest its involvement in the response to DNA double-strand breaks. Together, our results implicate USP3 as a novel chromatin modifier in the maintenance of genome integrity.",

Attenuation of growth factor signaling is essential for the regulation of developmental processes and tissue homeostasis in most organisms. The product of Cbl protooncogene is one such regulator, which functions as an ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and promotes the degradation of a variety of cell signaling proteins. Here, we demonstrate that Grb2 bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2 alpha forms a ternary complex with Cbl by means of its Src homology 3 domains resulting in the ubiquitination of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor and FRS2 alpha in response to FGF stimulation. These observations highlight the importance of FRS2 alpha in the assembly of both positive (i.e., Sos, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and negative (i.e., Cbl) signaling proteins to mediate a balanced FGF signal transduction. However, the partial inhibition of FGF receptor down-regulation in FRS2 alpha-/- cells indicates that the attenuation of signaling by FGF receptor is regulated by redundant or multiple mechanisms.",

In Xenopus, BMPs act as epidermal inducers and also as negative regulators of neurogenesis. Antagonism of BMP signaling results in neuralization. BMPs signal through the cell-surface receptors and downstream Smad molecules. Upon stimulation with BMP, Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are phosphorylated by the activated BMP receptors, form a complex with Smad4, and translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate the expression of BMP target genes. Here, we show that the Ski oncoprotein can block BMP signaling and the expression of BMP-responsive genes in both Xenopus and mammalian cells by directly interacting with and repressing the activity of BMP-specific Smad complexes. This ability to antagonize BMP signaling results in neuralization by Ski in the Xenopus embryo and blocking of osteoblast differentiation of murine W-20-17 cells. Thus, Ski is able to repress the activity of all receptor-associated Smads and may regulate vertebrate development by modulating the signaling activity of transforming growth factor-beta family members.",

Sequential multisite binding ensures strict selectivity toward light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin.  \nVisual arrestin plays an important role in regulating light responsiveness via its ability to specifically bind to the phosphorylated and light-activated form of rhodopsin. Previously, we utilized an in vitro translation system to express and characterize the full-length (404 amino acids) and two truncated forms of visual arrestin. Here we have extended these studies to include a total of 33 different truncation and deletion mutants of arrestin, ranging from 69 to 391 amino acids in length. Mutants were produced by cutting within the open reading frame of the bovine arrestin cDNA with selective restriction enzymes followed by in vitro translation of the transcribed truncated mRNAs. Mutant arrestin binding to dark, light-activated, dark phosphorylated, and light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin as well as to opsin, phosphoopsin, and truncated rhodopsin was then extensively characterized. In addition, the sensitivity of arrestin/rhodopsin interactions to conditions of increasing ionic strength was measured. These studies suggest the localization of multiple functional domains within the arrestin molecule that include: 1) a \"phosphorylation recognition\" domain, which interacts with the phosphorylated carboxyl terminus of rhodopsin, was localized predominately between residues 158-185; 2) an \"activation recognition\" domain, which interacts with those portions of the rhodopsin molecule that change conformation upon light activation, was found to consist of at least three regions within the first 191 residues of the arrestin molecule; 3) a hydrophobic interaction domain, localized between residues 191 and 365, appears to be mobilized upon binding of arrestin to activated phosphorylated rhodopsin; 4) a regulatory domain, localized in the COOH-terminal region of arrestin (residues 365-391), was found to play a role in controlling the conformational change in arrestin necessary for mobilization of the hydrophobic interaction domain; and 5) The NH2 terminus of arrestin (residues 2-16) was found to be important for interacting with the regulatory COOH-terminal region as well as maintaining the conformation of the NH2-terminal half of arrestin. A mechanism which ensures strict arrestin binding selectivity toward phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin is proposed.",

    "text": "Functional association between the insulin receptor and the transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase LAR in intact cells.  The receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase LAR (for leukocyte common antigen-related) has been implicated as a physiological regulator of the insulin receptor. To demonstrate a functional interaction between LAR and the insulin receptor, we incubated CHO cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor with an antibody to the extracellular domain of LAR and found a 47% decrease in insulin receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity. A physical association between LAR and the insulin receptor was then shown by immunoprecipitation of LAR from cell lysates and immunoblotting with antibody to the insulin receptor, or vice versa. Up to 11.8% of the LAR protein in the lysates of CHO cells overexpressing both the insulin receptor and LAR co-immunoprecipitated with the insulin receptor. The LAR/insulin receptor association was related to the level of LAR or insulin receptor overexpression and was increased 6.5-fold by chemical cross-linking and 3.9-fold by treatment with insulin, suggesting that receptor activation influences the affinity of LAR for the insulin receptor. In insulin-stimulated rat liver, LAR was temporally enriched in endosomes with the insulin receptor, and incubation of endosomes with neutralizing LAR antibodies decreased insulin receptor dephosphorylation in situ by 28% (p = 0.01 versus control). These data provide more direct evidence of a role for LAR in the physiological regulation of insulin action at the receptor level.",

    "text": "Increase in beta1-6 GlcNAc branching caused by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V directs integrin beta1 stability in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721.  In this study, an enzymatic inactive mutant of GnT-V (delta cGnT-V) was constructed and transfected in SMMC 7721 cell line. Integrin beta1 in delta cGnT-V transfectants (delta c-7721) showed attenuation of the number of beta1-6 GlcNAc branching, whereas those in wtGnT-V transfectants (wt-7721) presented a beta1-6 GlcNAc-rich pattern. High integrin beta1 expression was observed in wt-7721 compared with mock cells (7721 cell transfected with the vector pcDNA3), while transfection of delta cGnT-V decreased the integrin beta1 expression, despite of no significant changes on integrin beta1 mRNA level in these cell lines. Pulse-chase experiment showed that Integrin beta1 in delta c-7721 was prone to quick degradation and its half-life was less than 3 h, on the contrary, the alleviating degradation of beta1 subunit was observed in wt-7721 where the beta1 subunit half-life was about 16 h, meanwhile, the degradation rate of beta1 subunit in mock cells was in between, about 10 h. More effective in promoting cell migration toward fibronectin and invasion through Matrigel was observed in wt-7721 while this was almost suppressed in delta c-7721. Our results suggest that the addition of beta1-6 GlcNAc branching caused more fully glycosylated mature form on integrin beta1 and inhibited beta1 protein degradation. Glycosylation caused by GnT-V directs integrin beta1 stability and more delivery to plasma membrane, subsequently promotes Fn-based cell migration and invasion.",

    "text": "High occupancy of sigma-1 receptors in the human brain after single oral administration of fluvoxamine: a positron emission tomography study using [11C]SA4503.  \nBACKGROUND: Sigma-1 receptors might be implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases, as well as in the mechanisms of action of some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Among the several SSRIs, fluvoxamine has the highest affinity for sigma-1 receptors (Ki = 36 nM), whereas paroxetine shows low affinity (Ki = 1893 nM). The present study was undertaken to examine whether fluvoxamine binds to sigma-1 receptors in living human brain. METHODS: A dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data acquisition using the selective sigma-1 receptor ligand [(11)C]SA4503 was performed with arterial blood sampling to evaluate quantitatively the binding of [(11)C]SA4503 to sigma-1 receptors in 15 healthy male volunteers. Each subject had two PET scans before and after randomly receiving a single dose of either fluvoxamine (50, 100, 150, or 200 mg) or paroxetine (20 mg). The binding potential of [(11)C]SA4503 in 9 regions of the brain was calculated by a 2-tissue 3-compartment model. In addition, we examined the effects of functional polymorphisms of the sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) gene on the binding potential of [(11)C]SA4503. RESULTS: Fluvoxamine bound to sigma-1 receptors in all brain regions in a dose-dependent manner, whereas paroxetine did not bind to sigma-1 receptors. However, there was no association between the SIGMAR1 gene polymorphism GC-241-240TT and binding potential. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that fluvoxamine bound to sigma-1 receptors in living human brain at therapeutic doses. These findings suggest that sigma-1 receptors may play an important role in the mechanism of action of fluvoxamine.",

    "text": "Phosphotyrosines 627 and 659 of Gab1 constitute a bisphosphoryl tyrosine-based activation motif (BTAM) conferring binding and activation of SHP2.  A major Grb2-associated binder-1 (Gab1) binding partner in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated cells is protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) SHP2, which contains tandem SH2 domains. The SHP2 PTPase activity is required for activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase by EGF. To investigate the mechanism by which Gab1 and SHP2 mediate ERK activation, we characterized the Gab1-SHP2 interaction. We found that both Tyr-627 and Tyr-659 of Gab1 were required for SHP2 binding to Gab1 and for ERK2 activation by EGF. Far Western blot analysis suggested that the tandem SH2 domains of SHP2 bind to Gab1 in a specific orientation, in which the N-SH2 domain binds to phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P))-627 and the C-SH2 domain binds to Tyr(P)-659. When assayed with peptide substrates, SHP2 PTPase was activated by a bisphosphopeptide containing both Tyr(P)-627 and Tyr(P)-659, but not by monophosphopeptides containing Tyr(P)-627 or Tyr(P)-659 or a mixture of these monophosphopeptides. These results suggest that Tyr(P)-627 and Tyr(P)-659 of Gab1 constitute a bisphosphoryl tyrosine-based activation motif (BTAM) that binds and activates SHP2. Remarkably, while a constitutively active SHP2 (SHP2DeltaN) could not rescue the defect of a SHP2-binding defective Gab1 (Gab1FF) in ERK2 activation, expression of a Gab1FF-SHP2DeltaN chimera resulted in constitutive activation of ERK2 in transfected cells. Thus, physical association of activated SHP2 with Gab1 is necessary and sufficient to mediate the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Phosphopeptides derived from Gab1 were dephosphorylated by active SHP2 in vitro. Consistently, substrate-trapping experiments with a SHP2 catalytic inactive mutant suggested that Gab1 was a SHP2 PTPase substrate in the cells. Therefore, Gab1 not only is a SHP2 activator but also is a target of its PTPase.",

The checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain of hBRCA2, a protein involved in recombination-mediated DNA repair (HRR) and replication fork maintenance. Cells deficient in hBRCA2 are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents. Phosphorylation of the residue in hBRCA2 targeted by the Chk1 and Chk2 kinases regulates its interaction with Rad51. Furthermore, the cell line lex1/lex2, which lacks the carboxy-terminal domain containing the phosphorylated residue, does not support localization of Rad51 to nuclear foci after exposure to UV or treatment with ionizing radiation (IR). The data show that either phosphorylation of Rad51 by Chk1 or phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain of hBRCA2 by Chk1 or Chk2 plays a critical role in the binding of Rad51 to hBRCA2 and the subsequent recruitment of Rad51 to sites of DNA damage. While depletion of Chk1 from cells leads to loss of Rad51 localization to nuclear foci in response to replication arrest, cells lacking Chk2 also show a defect in Rad51 localization, but only in presence of double strand DNA breaks, indicating that each of these kinases may contribute somewhat differently to the formation of Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments depending on the type of DNA damage incurred by the cells.",

Calmodulin (CaM) is a key mediator of calcium-dependent signalling and is subject to regulatory post-translational modifications, including trimethylation of Lys-115. In this paper, we identify a class I, non-SET domain protein methyltransferase, calmodulin-lysine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.60). A polypeptide chosen from a fraction enriched in calmodulin methyltransferase activity was trypsinized and analysed by tandem mass spectrometry. The amino-acid sequence obtained identified conserved, homologous proteins of unknown function across a wide range of species, thus implicating a broad role for lysine methylation in calcium-dependent signalling. Encoded by c2orf34, the human homologue is a component of two related multigene deletion syndromes in humans. Human, rat, frog, insect and plant homologues were cloned and Escherichia coli-recombinant proteins catalysed the formation of a trimethyllysyl residue at position 115 in CaM, as verified by product analyses and mass spectrometry.",

These results constitute a step forward in our understanding of these pathways but also open other questions. What are the functions of Rab32 and Rab38? What are the effectors of Rab32 and Rab38 that facilitate trafficking to and fusion with melanosomes? What proteins are important for the regulation of Rab32 and Rab38? Little is known about the protein effectors of Rab32 and Rab38 beyond interaction with the protein Varp, which is implicated in the recruitment of the v-SNARE VAMP-7/TI-VAMP and Tyrp1 traffic. This Rab-Varp interaction is likely important for the vesicle-melanosome fusion event. Potential interactions of Rab32 and Rab38 with tethering proteins such as the HOmotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex could also facilitate trafficking or fusion of vesicles with melanosomes. Supporting this possibility, mutation of the HOPS complex subunit Vps33a results in deficient melanosome biogenesis in the buff mouse. However, the precise mechanisms that control the movement and targeting of vesicles remain unclear. The mechanisms used by Rab32 and Rab38 in the trafficking of transmembrane cargoes to melanosomes, and perhaps other LROs, will doubtless be investigated in future studies.",

    "text": "Two TPX2-dependent switches control the activity of Aurora A.  \nAurora A is an important oncogenic kinase for mitotic spindle assembly and a potentially attractive target for human cancers. Its activation could be regulated by ATP cycle and its activator TPX2. To understand the activation mechanism of Aurora A, a series of 20 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on both the wild-type kinase and its mutants. Analyzing the three dynamic trajectories (Aurora A-ATP, Aurora A-ADP, and Aurora A-ADP-TPX2) at the residue level, for the first time we find two TPX2-dependent switches, i.e., switch-1 (Lys-143) and switch-2 (Arg-180), which are tightly associated with Aurora A activation. In the absence of TPX2, Lys-143 exhibits a \"closed\" state, and becomes hydrogen-bonded to ADP. Once TPX2 binding occurs, switch-1 is forced to \"open\" the binding site, thus pulling ADP away from Aurora A. Without facilitation of TPX2, switch-2 exits in an \"open\" conformation which accompanies the outward-flipping movement of P*Thr288 (in an inactive conformation), leading to the crucial phosphothreonine exposed and accessible for deactivation. However, with the binding of TPX2, switch-2 is forced to undergo a \"closed\" movement, thus capturing P*Thr288 into a buried position and locking its active conformation. Analysis of two Aurora A (K143A and R180A) mutants for the two switches further verifies their functionality and reliability in controlling Aurora activity. Our systems therefore suggest two switches determining Aurora A activation, which are important for the development of aurora kinase inhibitors.",

Here, we demonstrate that Omi/HtrA2 directly cleaves various IAPs in vitro, and the cleavage efficiency is determined by its IAP-binding motif, AVPS. Cleavage of IAPs such as c-IAP1 substantially reduces its ability to inhibit and ubiquitylate caspases. In contrast to the stoichiometric anti-IAP activity by Smac/DIABLO, Omi/HtrA2 cleavage of c-IAP1 is catalytic and irreversible, thereby more efficiently inactivating IAPs and promoting caspase activity. Elimination of endogenous Omi by RNA interference abolishes c-IAP1 cleavage and desensitizes cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL. In addition, overexpression of cleavage-site mutant c-IAP1 makes cells more resistant to TRAIL-induced caspase activation. This IAP cleavage by Omi is independent of caspase. Taken together, these results indicate that unlike Smac/DIABLO, Omi/HtrA2's catalytic cleavage of IAPs is a key mechanism for it to irreversibly inactivate IAPs and promote apoptosis.",

    "text": "Concerted and differential actions of two enzymatic domains underlie Rad5 contributions to DNA damage tolerance.  \nMany genome maintenance factors have multiple enzymatic activities. In most cases, how their distinct activities functionally relate with each other is unclear. Here we examined the conserved budding yeast Rad5 protein that has both ubiquitin ligase and DNA helicase activities. The Rad5 ubiquitin ligase activity mediates PCNA poly-ubiquitination and subsequently recombination-based DNA lesion tolerance. Interestingly, the ligase domain is embedded in a larger helicase domain comprising seven consensus motifs. How features of the helicase domain influence ligase function is controversial. To clarify this issue, we use genetic, 2D gel and biochemical analyses and show that a Rad5 helicase motif important for ATP binding is also required for PCNA poly-ubiquitination and recombination-based lesion tolerance. We determine that this requirement is due to a previously unrecognized contribution of the motif to the PCNA and ubiquitination enzyme interaction, and not due to its canonical role in supporting helicase activity. We further show that Rad5's helicase-mediated contribution to replication stress survival is separable from recombination. These findings delineate how two Rad5 enzymatic domains concertedly influence PCNA modification, and unveil their discrete contributions to stress tolerance.",

However, the mechanism whereby delta-catenin is regulated in cells has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the possibility that glycogen-synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) phosphorylates delta-catenin and thus affects its stability. Initially, we found that the level of delta-catenin was greater and the half-life of delta-catenin was longer in GSK-3beta(-/-) fibroblasts than those in GSK-3beta(+/+) fibroblasts. Furthermore, four different approaches designed to specifically inhibit GSK-3 activity, i.e. GSK-3-specific chemical inhibitors, Wnt-3a conditioned media, small interfering RNAs, and GSK-3alpha and -3beta kinase dead constructs, consistently showed that the levels of endogenous delta-catenin in CWR22Rv-1 prostate carcinoma cells and primary cortical neurons were increased by inhibiting GSK-3 activity. In addition, it was found that both GSK-3alpha and -3beta interact with and phosphorylate delta-catenin. The phosphorylation of DeltaC207-delta-catenin (lacking 207 C-terminal residues) and T1078A delta-catenin by GSK-3 was noticeably reduced compared with that of wild type delta-catenin, and the data from liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses suggest that the Thr(1078) residue of delta-catenin is one of the GSK-3 phosphorylation sites. Treatment with MG132 or ALLN, specific inhibitors of proteosome-dependent proteolysis, increased delta-catenin levels and caused an accumulation of ubiquitinated delta-catenin. It was also found that GSK-3 triggers the ubiquitination of delta-catenin. These results suggest that GSK-3 interacts with and phosphorylates delta-catenin and thereby negatively affects its stability by enabling its ubiquitination/proteosome-mediated proteolysis.",

In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, Wnt signal is passed from the membrane Wnt receptor Fz to Dvl, which then relays the signal to downstream components. The direct recognition between Dvl PDZ domain and a conserved sequence (KTXXXW) in Fz, localized two residues after the seventh transmembrane domain, is the key interaction in the pathway. Indeed, Dvl PDZ-binding peptides as well as small molecules targeting the Dvl PDZ domain can effectively block Wnt signaling. Here we show that sulindac and sulindac sulfone bind the peptide-binding site of the Dvl PDZ domain with an affinity comparable to that of the native binding partners and that, like other Dvl PDZ inhibitors, sulindac blocks Wnt signaling at the Dvl level in Xenopus. Therefore, we propose that sulindac exerts its chemoprotective anticancer effect not only by inhibiting COX enzymes but also by inhibiting Wnt signaling via Dvl.",

Although histone methyltransferases are known, enzymes that demethylate histones have not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that human peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) regulates histone Arg methylation by converting methyl-Arg to citrulline and releasing methylamine. PAD4 targets multiple sites in histones H3 and H4, including those sites methylated by coactivators CARM1 (H3 Arg17) and PRMT1 (H4 Arg3). A decrease of histone Arg methylation, with a concomitant increase of citrullination, requires PAD4 activity in human HL-60 granulocytes. Moreover, PAD4 activity is linked with the transcriptional regulation of estrogen-responsive genes in MCF-7 cells. These data suggest that PAD4 mediates gene expression by regulating Arg methylation and citrullination in histones.",

RDM1 interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II), ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4), and the de novo DNA methyltransferase DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE2 (DRM2) and binds to methylated single stranded DNA. As the only protein identified so far that interacts directly with DRM2, RDM1 plays a pivotal role in the RdDM mechanism by linking the de novo DNA methyltransferase activity to AGO4, which binds short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that presumably base-pair with Pol II or Pol V scaffold transcripts synthesized at target loci. RDM1 also acts together with the chromatin remodeler DEFECTIVE IN RNA-DIRECTED DNA METHYLATION1 (DRD1) and the structural-maintenance-of-chromosomes solo hinge protein DEFECTIVE IN MERISTEM SILENCING3 (DMS3) to form the DDR complex, which facilitates synthesis of Pol V scaffold transcripts. The manner in which RDM1 acts in both the DDR complex and as a factor bridging DRM2 and AGO4 remains unclear. RDM1 contains no known protein domains but a prior structural analysis suggested distinct regions that create a hydrophobic pocket and promote homodimer formation, respectively. We have tested several mutated forms of RDM1 altered in the predicted pocket and dimerization regions for their ability to complement defects in RdDM and transcriptional gene silencing, support synthesis of Pol V transcripts, form homodimers, and interact with DMS3. Our results indicate that the ability to form homodimers is essential for RDM1 to function fully in the RdDM pathway and may be particularly important during the de novo methylation step.",

In the present study, we provide first-time evidence for the existence of multiple species of Cdc25C in mitotic cell extracts, including full-length and splice variants with different phosphorylation patterns, thereby revealing an intricate network of Cdc25C phosphatases, likely to have distinct biological functions.",

    "text": "Structure of tracheal cytotoxin in complex with a heterodimeric pattern-recognition receptor.  \nTracheal cytotoxin (TCT), a naturally occurring fragment of Gram-negative peptidoglycan, is a potent elicitor of innate immune responses in Drosophila. It induces the heterodimerization of its recognition receptors, the peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) LCa and LCx, which activates the immune deficiency pathway. The crystal structure at 2.1 angstrom resolution of TCT in complex with the ectodomains of PGRP-LCa and PGRP-LCx shows that TCT is bound to and presented by the LCx ectodomain for recognition by the LCa ectodomain; the latter lacks a canonical peptidoglycan-docking groove conserved in other PGRPs. The interface, revealed in atomic detail, between TCT and the receptor complex highlights the importance of the anhydro-containing disaccharide in bridging the two ectodomains together and the critical role of diaminopimelic acid as the specificity determinant for PGRP interaction.",

We analyzed how H3 histone methylation and demethylation control expression of estrogen-responsive genes and show that a DNA-bound estrogen receptor directs transcription by participating in bending chromatin to contact the RNA polymerase II recruited to the promoter. This process is driven by receptor-targeted demethylation of H3 lysine 9 at both enhancer and promoter sites and is achieved by activation of resident LSD1 demethylase. Localized demethylation produces hydrogen peroxide, which modifies the surrounding DNA and recruits 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1 and topoisomeraseIIbeta, triggering chromatin and DNA conformational changes that are essential for estrogen-induced transcription. Our data show a strategy that uses controlled DNA damage and repair to guide productive transcription.",

Smurf1 then associates with transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor (TbetaR-I) and enhances the turnover of this receptor. However, the mechanisms of the nuclear export and plasma membrane localization of the Smurf1.Smad7 complex have not been elucidated. We show here that Smurf1 targets Smad7 to the plasma membrane through its N-terminal conserved 2 (C2) domain. Both wild-type Smurf1 (Smurf1(WT)) and Smurf1 lacking the C2 domain (Smurf1(deltaC2)) bound to Smad7 and translocated nuclear Smad7 to the cytoplasm. However, unlike Smurf1(WT), Smurf1(deltaC2) did not move to the plasma membrane and failed to recruit Smad7 to the cell surface TbetaR-II.TbetaR-I complex. Moreover, although Smurf1(deltaC2) induced ubiquitination of Smad7, it failed to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of TbetaR-I and did not enhance the inhibitory activity of Smad7. Thus, these results suggest that the plasma membrane localization of Smad7 by Smurf1 requires the C2 domain of Smurf1 and is essential for the inhibitory effect of Smad7 in the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway.",

The mechanism of dephosphorylation and signal termination is unknown. Here, we identify a protein phosphatase, PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP), that specifically dephosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of Akt (Ser473 in Akt1), triggering apoptosis and suppressing tumor growth. The effects of PHLPP on apoptosis are prevented in cells expressing an S473D construct of Akt, revealing that the hydrophobic motif is the primary cellular target of PHLPP. PHLPP levels are markedly reduced in several colon cancer and glioblastoma cell lines that have elevated Akt phosphorylation. Reintroduction of PHLPP into a glioblastoma cell line causes a dramatic suppression of tumor growth. These data are consistent with PHLPP terminating Akt signaling by directly dephosphorylating and inactivating Akt.",

One child developed progressive dyspnea of insidious onset by 3-4 years and diffuse lung disease and respiratory insufficiency by 6 years. Lung histopathology was similar to autoimmune PAP and GM-CSF deficient mice. However, GM-CSF autoantibodies were absent and GM-CSF levels were elevated in the lungs and serum. The GM-CSF receptor beta chain was present and had a normal nucleotide sequence. However, the alpha chain had a reduced molecular weight, abnormal glycosylation pattern, reduced GM-CSF binding, and impaired activation of STAT5. Karyotyping, genomic chromosomal hybridization, and high resolution SNP analysis revealed a 1.6 Mb deletion in the pseudo-autosomal region at Xp22.33 encompassing the maternal CSF2RA allele, and a point mutation (G196R) in the paternal CSF2RA allele that altered glycosylation of the GM-CSF receptor alpha peptide and markedly reduced GM-CSF binding. This child's asymptomatic 8-year-old sister had increased serum GM-CSF and SP-D (both markers of PAP lung disease severity) and subsequent radiological and pulmonary function abnormalities demonstrated she had PAP. A 4 year old child developed PAP in association with Turner's syndrome and loss of both CSF2RA alleles. Subsequent screening of pediatric patients with unexplained PAP (i.e., who were negative for GM-CSF autoantibody) for an elevated serum GM-CSF level resulted in identification of 5 additional patients aged 3-11 years of age with PAP caused by various CSF2RA mutations (B.C.T., unpublished results). Together, these cases indicate that loss of GM-CSF receptor function causes hereditary PAP, but that additional factors determine the severity of lung disease in PAP.",

In a model B-cell line, PTP-PEST was found to be constitutively associated with several signalling molecules, including Shc, paxillin, Csk and Cas. The interaction between Shc and PTP-PEST was augmented further by antigen receptor stimulation. Overexpression studies, antisense experiments and structure-function analyses provided evidence that PTP-PEST is an efficient negative regulator of lymphocyte activation. This function correlated with the ability of PTP-PEST to induce dephosphorylation of Shc, Pyk2, Fak and Cas, and inactivate the Ras pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that PTP-PEST is a novel and unique component of the inhibitory signalling machinery in lymphocytes.",

It is probable that exogenously added alpha-SNAP must first interact with an endogenous factor, probably SNAREs, before the stimulation of NSF. Addition of an alpha-SNAP mutant that is able to bind but not stimulate NSF would be predicted to inhibit the action of exogenously added alpha-SNAP in chromaffin cells. To test this possibility, digitonin-permeabilized chromaffin cells were preincubated with either buffer, alpha-SNAP (1-160) (as a control), alpha-SNAP (1-285), or alpha-SNAP (L294A) for 25 min and stimulated with 10 muM Ca2+ for 30 min with or without 25 mug/ml alpha-SNAP. The results of four separate experiments were averaged, and the results were expressed as a percentage of the 10 muM Ca2+ stimulation. When preincubated with buffer alone, alpha-SNAP stimulated exocytosis above control levels (Fig. 5 B). Preincubation with alpha-SNAP (1-160) had no inhibitory effect on alpha-SNAP action (Fig. 5 B), which would be predicted because such a large truncation would abolish the ability to interact with SNAREs. However, addition of 25 mug/ml of either alpha-SNAP (1-285) or alpha-SNAP (L294A) resulted in the complete inhibition of the stimulatory activity of exogenous alpha-SNAP. The inhibitory effect of these mutants was still seen, even when an additional 10-min wash step was added between incubation of mutant proteins and the stimulation in the presence of alpha-SNAP (data not shown). It should be noted that the mutants alpha-SNAP (1-285) and alpha-SNAP (L294A) had little effect on endogenous exocytosis in the absence of added alpha-SNAP, nor did they do so even up to concentrations as high as 150 mug/ml (data not shown).",

An additional possibility could be that PRC2 sumoylation may play a role in regulating non-chromatin associated PRC2 functions. The fact that we detect sumoylation of nuclear SUZ12 upon SUMO and UBC9 overexpression (data not shown) does not support this but further experiments in this direction will be required to validate such hypothesis.",

Tyr142, the C-terminal amino acid of histone variant H2A.X is phosphorylated by WSTF (Williams-Beuren syndrome transcription factor), a component of the WICH complex (WSTF-ISWI chromatin-remodeling complex), under basal conditions in the cell. In response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), H2A.X is instantaneously phosphorylated at Ser139 by the kinases ATM and ATR and is progressively dephosphorylated at Tyr142 by the Eya1 and Eya3 tyrosine phosphatases, resulting in a temporal switch from a postulated diphosphorylated (pSer139, pTyr142) to monophosphorylated (pSer139) H2A.X state. How mediator proteins interpret these two signals remains a question of fundamental interest. We provide structural, biochemical, and cellular evidence that Microcephalin (MCPH1), an early DNA damage response protein, can read both modifications via its tandem BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains, thereby emerging as a versatile sensor of H2A.X phosphorylation marks. We show that MCPH1 recruitment to sites of DNA damage is linked to both states of H2A.X.",

The organization of chromatin into higher-order structures influences chromosome function and epigenetic gene regulation. Higher-order chromatin has been proposed to be nucleated by the covalent modification of histone tails and the subsequent establishment of chromosomal subdomains by non-histone modifier factors. Here we show that human SUV39H1 and murine Suv39h1--mammalian homologues of Drosophila Su(var)3-9 and of Schizosaccharomyces pombe clr4--encode histone H3-specific methyltransferases that selectively methylate lysine 9 of the amino terminus of histone H3 in vitro. We mapped the catalytic motif to the evolutionarily conserved SET domain, which requires adjacent cysteine-rich regions to confer histone methyltransferase activity. Methylation of lysine 9 interferes with phosphorylation of serine 10, but is also influenced by pre-existing modifications in the amino terminus of H3. In vivo, deregulated SUV39H1 or disrupted Suv39h activity modulate H3 serine 10 phosphorylation in native chromatin and induce aberrant mitotic divisions. Our data reveal a functional interdependence of site-specific H3 tail modifications and suggest a dynamic mechanism for the regulation of higher-order chromatin.",

Previous studies have suggested that FOXM1 regulates CDC25A gene transcription, but the mechanism remains unknown. Here, we provide evidence that FOXM1 directly regulates CDC25A gene transcription via direct promoter binding and indirect activation of E2F-dependent pathways. Prior literature reported that CDC25B and CDC25C activate CDK1/cyclinB complexes in order to enable phosphorylation of FOXM1. It was unknown if CDC25A functions in a similar manner. We report that FOXM1 transcriptional activity is synergistically enhanced when co-expressed with CDC25A. The increase is dependent upon CDK1 phosphorylation of FOXM1 at T600, T611 and T620 residues. We also report a novel protein interaction between FOXM1 and CDC25A via the C-terminus of FOXM1. We demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Thr 600 and Thr 611 residues of FOXM1 enhanced this interaction, and that the interaction is dependent upon CDC25A phosphatase activity. Our work provides novel insight into the underlying mechanisms by which FOXM1 controls the cell cycle through its association with CDC25A.",

Here we report the autoinhibited structure of the GTPase-binding domain of WASP, which can be induced by the C-terminal region or by organic co-solvents. In the autoinhibited complex, intramolecular interactions with the GTPase-binding domain occlude residues of the C terminus that regulate the Arp2/3 actin-nucleating complex. Binding of Cdc42 to the GTPase-binding domain causes a dramatic conformational change, resulting in disruption of the hydrophobic core and release of the C terminus, enabling its interaction with the actin regulatory machinery.

Complete inhibition of GH activation of the signal transducer STAT5b and STAT5b-dependent transcriptional activity was observed upon expression of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3, while partial inhibition (CIS, SOCS-2) or no inhibition (SOCS-6) was seen with other SOCS/CIS family members. SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and CIS each strongly inhibited the GH receptor (GHR)-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 seen at low levels of transfected JAK2; however, only SOCS-1 strongly inhibited the GHR-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 seen at higher JAK2 levels. To probe for interactions with GHR, in vitro binding assays were carried out using glutathione S-transferase-GHR fusion proteins containing variable lengths of GHR's COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain. CIS and SOCS-2 bound to fusions containing as few as 80 COOH-terminal GHR residues, provided the fusion protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated. By contrast, SOCS-3 binding required tyrosine-phosphorylated GHR membrane-proximal sequences, SOCS-1 binding was tyrosine phosphorylation-independent, and SOCS-6 did not bind the GHR fusion proteins at all. Mutation of GHR's membrane-proximal tyrosine residues 333 and 338 to phenylalanine suppressed the inhibition by SOCS-3, but not by CIS, of GH signaling to STAT5b. SOCS/CIS proteins can thus inhibit GH signaling to STAT5b by three distinct mechanisms, distinguished by their molecular targets within the GHR-JAK2 signaling complex, as exemplified by SOCS-1 (direct JAK2 kinase inhibition), SOCS-3 (inhibition of JAK2 signaling via membrane-proximal GHR tyrosines 333 and 338), and CIS and SOCS-2 (inhibition via membrane-distal tyrosine(s)).",

DNA damage-induced HIPK2 directly phosphorylates Pc2 at multiple sites, which in turn controls Pc2 sumoylation and intranuclear localization. Inducible phosphorylation of Pc2 at threonine 495 is required for its ability to increase HIPK2 sumoylation in response to DNA damage, thereby establishing an autoregulatory feedback loop between a SUMO substrate and its cognate E3 ligase. Sumoylation enhances the ability of HIPK2 to mediate transcriptional repression, thus providing a mechanistic link for DNA damage-induced transcriptional silencing.",

    "text": "Role of the NEDD8 modification of Cul2 in the sequential activation of ECV complex.  ECV is an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is composed of elongins B and C, Rbx1, Cul2, and the substrate-conferring von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor protein that targets the catalytic alpha subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for oxygen-dependent ubiquitin-mediated destruction. Mutations in VHL that compromise proper HIFalpha regulation through ECV have been documented in the majority of renal cell carcinomas, underscoring the significance of the VHL-HIF pathway in renal epithelial oncogenesis. Recent evidence has shown that the modification of Cul2 by the ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8 increases the activity of ECV to ubiquitylate HIFalpha. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for the NEDD8-mediated induction of ECV function is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that oxygen-dependent recognition of HIFalpha by VHL triggers Rbx1-dependent neddylation of Cul2, which preferentially engages the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5a. These events establish a central role for the neddylation of Cul2 in a previously unrecognized, temporally coordinated activation of ECV with the recruitment of its substrate HIFalpha.",

We report the isolation of a CUL1 binding protein, p120(CAND1). We found the majority of CUL1 is in a complex with CAND1 and ROC1 independent of SKP1 and F box protein SKP2. Both in vivo and in vitro, CAND1 prevents the binding of SKP1 and SKP2 to CUL1 while dissociation of CAND1 from CUL1 promotes the reverse reaction. Neddylation of CUL1 or the presence of SKP1 and ATP causes CAND1 dissociation. Our data suggest that CAND1 regulates the formation of the SCF complex, and its dissociation from CUL1 is coupled with the incorporation of F box proteins into the SCF complex, causing their destabilization.",

Methylation of histone H3-lysine 27 by the EZH2 complex has been linked to the silencing of homeotic genes and the inactivation of the X chromosome. Here we report a characterization of the substrate preferences of the enzyme complex using a reconstituted chromatin and enzyme system. We found that the linker histone H1, when incorporated into nucleosomes, stimulates the enzymatic activity toward histone H3. This stimulatory activity may be explained by protein-protein interactions between H1 and components of the EZH2 complex. In addition, we found that the EZH2 complex exhibits a dramatic preference for dinucleosomes when compared with mononucleosomes and that the stimulation of H3 methylation by H1 requires dinucleosomes or oligonucleosome substrates. Furthermore, in contrast with a recent study suggesting that Embryonic Ectoderm Development EED isoforms may affect substrate specificity, we found that EZH2 complexes reconstituted with different EED isoforms exhibit similar substrate preference and specificity. Our work supports the hypothesis that linker histone H1 and chromatin structure are important factors in determining the substrate preference of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase complex.",

Vapor diffused hanging drops at 22degreesC with a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of the Rev-erbalpha NCoR complex and the precipitant solution produced 100-200 microM crystals within a few days. Precipitant solutions contained 6-9% PEG 3350, 8% glycerol, 200 mM proline, and 80 mM HEPES at pH 7.5. Prior to flash freezing in liquid N2, the crystals were transiently mixed with a cryoprotectant solvent consisting of the precipitant solution amended with 20% glycerol. X-ray diffraction data at 100degreesK from a single crystal data were collected at a 1Aa wavelength using a MAR165 detector at the IMCA-CAT, sector 17ID at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron. HKL2000 was used to index, integrate and scale the data. The structure was solved using a proprietary liganded Rev-erbalpha NCoR structure solved to 1.9Aa with heavy atom phases (to be published). A search model derived from hVDR (1db1) lacking helix 12 also yielded a valid solution by molecular replacement with AMORE or MOLREP. The resulting structure contains one molecule in the asymmetric unit that forms a symmetric dimer along helix alpha10 with an adjacent molecule. The initial model was iteratively built with Quanta (Accelrys) and refined with CNX and the final structure built with COOT and refined with Refmac using all hydrogens and maximum likelihood restraints. The crystallographic data and final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Reported interatomic distances are between heavy atoms unless specified and were measured with COOT or PyMol. The COOT SSM utility was employed to superimpose previously published structures upon the Rev-erbalpha monomeric LBD. The deposited coordinates have a MolProbity structure quality score of 1.89 (98%) and Ramachandran analysis within COOT reported that 191 residues are in the preferred, 4 in the allowed and 2 in the outlier regions.

    "text": "Based on the homology model of G12C K-Ras, Lim et al. designed a GDP analogue, SML-8-73-1 (SML, 1) (Fig. 5B), which has a high likelihood of forming a covalent inhibitor with Cys12. Subsequent mass spectroscopy (MS) experiments confirmed that SML was able to covalently modify G12C K-Ras, but did not label WT K-Ras. To further illuminate the binding mode between SML and G12C K-Ras, Hunter et al. solved the co-crystal structure of G12C K-Ras bound to SML (PDB ID 4NMM, Fig. 5C) as well as the structures of WT (PDB ID 4OBE) and G12C (PDB ID 4LDJ) GDP-bound K-Ras. Backbone superimposition of the crystal structures of K-RasG12C-GDP and K-RasWT-GDP onto that of K-RasG12C-SML exhibits that the overall conformation of K-Ras is extremely similar among three structures and that the orientation of SML in the active site of K-RasG12C is also nearly identical to those of GDP in the K-RasG12C and K-RasWT (Fig. 5D), ruling out the possibility that covalent modification of Cys12 by SML results in extensive conformational remodeling of the switch I and switch II regions. Thus, the resulting conformation of K-RasG12C is in the open, inactive conformation upon SML binding, which is incapable of interacting with downstream effector proteins. To test this hypothesis, the structure of K-RasG12C-SML was superimposed onto those of H-Ras-GppNHp in complex with the RBD of Raf kinase (Raf-RBD) (PDB ID 4G0N) and PI3Kgamma (PDB ID 1HE8), respectively. Remarkably, compared to the formation of exquisite salt bridge networks between the switch I region of H-Ras-GppNHp and Raf-RBD and PI3Kgamma, no salt bridges were formed between the switch I region of K-RasG12C-SML and Raf-RBD (Fig. 6A) and PI3Kgamma (Fig. 6B). Moreover, a steric conflict between the switch I region of K-RasG12C-SML and the beta-strands of Raf-RBD and PI3Kgamma was observed. Functional biochemical assay through the AlphaScreen technology was performed to assess the affinity between K-RasG12C-GppNHp/-GDP and Raf-RBD in the presence or absence of SML. The results showed that K-RasG12C-GppNHp strongly interacts with Raf-RBD with an EC50 of 6.6 nM, which has a higher affinity than the interaction between K-RasG12C-GDP and RafRBD with an EC50 of 22.6 nM. The AlphaScreen assay further revealed that the affinity of K-RasG12C-SML for RafRBD is nearly identical to that of K-RasG12C-GDP for Raf-RBD. These data suggest that SML binding to the active site of Ras is likely to prevent the activation of Ras downstream signaling.",

As described previously, the three predicted splice variants of mig-10 encode isoforms that differ only in their N-termini (Fig. 1). In particular, the N-terminus of MIG-10A contains a proline-rich region with a putative SH3 binding site that is missing in MIG-10B, the smallest isoform. MIG-10B:V5 also co-immunoprecipitated with wild type ABI-1:GFP (Fig. 2E), demonstrating that both isoforms are capable of interaction with ABI-1, and suggesting that the N-termini of the MIG-10 isoforms are not essential to the interaction.",

This steroid-binding inhibition was fully reversed when reducing agents were added to kidney cytosol obtained from mice treated for 5 h, but it was only partially reversed in cytosol obtained from mice treated for 10 days. Although the oligomeric structure of the MR-hsp90 heterocomplex was always unaffected, a decreased amount of MR protein was evidenced after the long term treatment. Such a deleterious effect was correlated with a post-translational modification of MR, as demonstrated by an increased level of receptor carbonylation. In addition, a failure at the elongation/termination step was also observed during the receptor translation process in a reticulocyte lysate system. Thus, a high polyribosomes/monomers ratio and both increased proteolysis and decreased ADP-ribosylatable concentration of elongation factor 2 (EF-2) were shown. Importantly, similar observations were also performed in vivo after depletion of glutathione. Notwithstanding the EF-2 functional disruption, not all renal proteins were equally affected as the MR. Interestingly, both EF-2 and MR expressed in old mice were similarly affected as in L-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine-treated young mice. We therefore propose that a dramatic depletion of glutathione in kidney cells mimics the cumulative effect of aging which, at the end, may lead to a renal mineralocorticoid dysfunction.",

Serine phosphorylation of the ShcA signaling molecule has been reported recently. In this work, we have identified 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)- and growth factor-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in p52(Shc) and p66(Shc). Among them, Ser(29) in p52(Shc) (equivalent to Ser(138) in p66(Shc)) was phosphorylated only after TPA stimulation. Phosphorylation of this site together with the intact phosphotyrosine-binding domain was essential for ShcA binding to the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST. TPA-induced ShcA phosphorylation at this site (and hence, its association with PTP-PEST) was inhibited by a protein kinase C-specific inhibitor and was induced by overexpression of constitutively active mutants of protein kinase Calpha, -epsilon, and -delta isoforms. Insulin also induced ShcA/PTP-PEST association, although to a lesser extent than TPA. Overexpression of a PTP-PEST binding-defective mutant of p52(Shc) (S29A) enhanced insulin-induced ERK activation in insulin receptor-overexpressing HIRc-B cells. Consistent with this, p52(Shc) S29A was more tyrosine-phosphorylated than wild-type p52(Shc) after insulin stimulation. Thus, we have identified a new mechanism whereby serine phosphorylation of ShcA controls the ability of its phosphotyrosine-binding domain to bind PTP-PEST, which is responsible for the dephosphorylation and down-regulation of ShcA after insulin stimulation.",

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ash1 is a specific repressor of transcription that localizes asymmetrically to the daughter cell nucleus through the localization of ASH1 mRNA to the distal tip of the daughter cell. This localization depends on the actin cytoskeleton and five She proteins, one of which is a type V myosin motor, Myo4. We show here that a novel RNA-binding protein, Khd1 (KH-domain protein 1), is required for efficient localization of ASH1 mRNA to the distal tip of the daughter cell. Visualization of ASH1 mRNA in vivo using GFP-tagged RNA demonstrated that Khd1 associates with the N element, a cis-acting localization sequence within the ASH1 mRNA. Co-immunoprecipitation studies also indicated that Khd1 associates with ASH1 mRNA through the N element. A khd1Delta mutation exacerbates the phenotype of a weak myo4 mutation, whereas overexpression of KHD1 decreases the concentration of Ash1 protein and restores HO expression to she mutants. These results suggest that Khd1 may function in the linkage between ASH1 mRNA localization and its translation.",

Synphilin-1 was shown to interact with alpha-synuclein and to promote the formation of cytosolic inclusions. We now report that synphilin-1 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin-ligases SIAH-1 and SIAH-2. SIAH proteins ubiquitylate synphilin-1 both in vitro and in vivo, promoting its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Inability of the proteasome to degrade synphilin-1/SIAH complex leads to a robust formation of ubiquitylated cytosolic inclusions. Ubiquitylation is required for inclusion formation, because a catalytically inactive mutant of SIAH-1, which still binds to synphilin-1, fails to promote inclusions. Like synphilin-1, alpha-synuclein associates with SIAH in intact cells, but the interaction with SIAH-2 was much stronger that with SIAH-1. In vitro experiments show that SIAH-2 monoubiquitylates alpha-synuclein. Further evidence that SIAH proteins may play a role in inclusion formation comes from the demonstration of SIAH immunoreactivity in Lewy bodies of PD patients.",

DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of M (r) 32 kDa) is a signal transduction molecule that regulates the efficacy of dopamine signaling in neostriatal neurons. Dopamine signaling is mediated in part through phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr34 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and antagonized by phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr75 by cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5. We have now investigated the effects of the ionotropic glutamate NMDA and AMPA receptors on DARPP-32 phosphorylation in neostriatal slices. Activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors decreased the state of phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr34 and Thr75. The decrease in Thr34 phosphorylation was mediated through Ca(2+) -dependent activation of the Ca(2+) -/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. In contrast, the decrease in Thr75 phosphorylation was mediated through Ca(2+) -dependent activation of dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase-2A. The results provide support for a complex effect of glutamate on dopaminergic signaling through the regulation of dephosphorylation of different sites of DARPP-32 by different protein phosphatases.",

To provide a structural basis for insight in the catalytic mechanism, we determined the structure of MPGES1 in complex with glutathione by electron crystallography from 2D crystals induced in the presence of phospholipids. Together with results from site-directed mutagenesis and activity measurements, we can thereby demonstrate the role of specific amino acid residues. Glutathione is found to bind in a U-shaped conformation at the interface between subunits in the protein trimer. It is exposed to a site facing the lipid bilayer, which forms the specific environment for the oxidoreduction of PGH(2) to PGE(2) after displacement of the cytoplasmic half of the N-terminal transmembrane helix. Hence, insight into the dynamic behavior of MPGES1 and homologous membrane proteins in inflammation and detoxification is provided.",

    "text": "Identification and characterization of a nuclear interacting partner of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NIPA). \nAnaplastic large-cell lymphoma is a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphomas characterized by the expression of CD30. More than half of these lymphomas carry a chromosomal translocation t(2;5) leading to expression of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK). NPM-ALK is capable of transforming fibroblasts and lymphocytes in vitro and of causing lymphomas in mice. Previously, we and others demonstrated phospholipase C-gamma and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase as crucial downstream signaling mediators of NPM-ALK-induced oncogenicity. In this study, we used an ALK fusion protein as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen identifying NIPA (nuclear interacting partner of ALK) as a novel downstream target of NPM-ALK. NIPA encodes a 60-kDa protein that is expressed in a broad range of human tissues and contains a classical nuclear translocation signal in its C terminus, which directs its nuclear localization. NIPA interacts with NPM-ALK and other ALK fusions in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner and is phosphorylated in NPM-ALK-expressing cells on tyrosine and serine residues with serine 354 as a major phosphorylation site. Overexpression of NIPA in Ba/F3 cells was able to protect from apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal. Mutations of the nuclear translocation signal or the Ser-354 phosphorylation site impaired the antiapoptotic function of NIPA. In NPM-ALK-transformed Ba/F3 cells, apoptosis triggered by wortmannin treatment was enhanced by overexpression of putative dominant-negative NIPA mutants. These results implicate an antiapoptotic role for NIPA in NPM-ALK-mediated signaling events.",

However, a carboxyl-terminal fragment of Pc2 that recruits both Ubc9 and CtBP lacks E3 activity. We identify a second domain, which, when coexpressed with the carboxyl-terminal adapter region, restores E3 function. In vitro, this domain has E3 activity in isolation, suggesting that it is a functional domain, and that adapter function is required to selectively corecruit E2 and substrate in vivo. These results demonstrate the presence of two domains in Pc2 that contribute to full in vivo E3 activity, and suggest that SUMO E3s are more than simple platforms to which E2 and substrate bind.",

    "text": "The chromatin remodeling factor CSB recruits histone acetyltransferase PCAF to rRNA gene promoters in active state for transcription initiation.  The promoters of poised rRNA genes (rDNA) are marked by both euchromatic and heterochromatic histone modifications and are associated with two transcription factors, UBF and SL1 that nucleate transcription complex formation. Active rRNA genes contain only euchromatic histone modifications and are loaded with all components of transcriptional initiation complex including RNA polymerase I. Coupled with histone acetylation and RNA polymerase I targeting, poised promoters can be converted to active ones by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor CSB for initiation of rDNA transcription. However, it is not clear how dynamic histone modifications induce the assembly of polymerase I transcription initiation complex to active promoters during such conversion. Here we show that a complex consisting of CSB, RNA polymerase I and histone acetyltransferase PCAF is present at the rDNA promoters in active state. CSB is required for the association of PCAF with rDNA, which induces acetylation of histone H4 and histone H3K9. Overexpression of CSB promotes the association of PCAF with rDNA. Knockdown of PCAF leads to decreased levels of H4ac and H3K9ac at rDNA promoters, prevents the association of RNA polymerase I and inhibits pre-rRNA synthesis. The results demonstrate that CSB recruits PCAF to rDNA, which allows histone acetylation that is required for the assembly of polymerase I transcription initiation complex during the transition from poised to active state of rRNA genes, suggesting that CSB and PCAF play cooperative roles to establish the active state of rRNA genes by histone acetylation.",

The accessory motors may function to modulate IFT itself, they may target specific proteins to cilia, or they may function as stable components of the cilium itself. For example, in wild-type C. elegans, sensory cilia are assembled by two members of the kinesin-2 family, the core motor kinesin-II and the accessory kinesin OSM-3 (Fig. 1 b), whereas osm-3 mutants resemble Chlamydomonas, Tetrahymena, Drosophila, sea urchin, and mouse, in which disrupting the function of heterotrimeric kinesin-2 alone leads to the loss of cilia. The peculiar feature of C. elegans is that in klp-11 and kap-1 single mutants lacking kinesin-II function, OSM-3 alone appears capable of building the full-length cilium. Thus, in wild types, both motors function redundantly to carry out the important task of building the cilium foundation, which can form after the loss of either kinesin-II or OSM-3. Subsequently, the accessory motor OSM-3 alone specifically extends the distal singlets to confer cilia-specific chemosensory functions (i.e., osmotic avoidance).",

We have previously identified a novel muscle-specific actin-binding protein, STARS (striated muscle activator of Rho signaling), which directly binds actin and stimulates serum-response factor (SRF)-dependent transcription. To further dissect the STARS/SRF pathway, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a skeletal muscle cDNA library using STARS as bait, and we identified two novel members of the ABLIM protein family, ABLIM-2 and -3, as STARS-interacting proteins. ABLIM-1, which is expressed in retina, brain, and muscle tissue, has been postulated to function as a tumor suppressor. ABLIM-2 and -3 display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns with the highest expression levels in muscle and neuronal tissue. Moreover, these novel ABLIM proteins strongly bind F-actin, are localized to actin stress fibers, and synergistically enhance STARS-dependent activation of SRF. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous ABLIM expression utilizing small interfering RNA significantly blunted SRF-dependent transcription in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. These findings suggest that the members of the novel ABLIM protein family may serve as a scaffold for signaling modules of the actin cytoskeleton and thereby modulate transcription.",

Here we show that Plk3 is rapidly activated by reactive oxygen species in normal diploid fibroblast cells (WI-38), correlating with a subsequent increase in p53 protein level. Plk3 physically interacts with Chk2 and the interaction is enhanced upon DNA damage. In addition, Chk2 immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of Daudi (which expressed little Plk3) is capable of stimulating the kinase activity of purified recombinant Plk3 in vitro, and this stimulation is more pronounced when Plk3 is supplemented with Chk2 immunoprecipitated from Daudi after DNA damage. Furthermore, ectopic expression Chk2 activates cellular Plk3. Together, our studies suggest Chk2 may mediate direct activation of Plk3 in response to genotoxic stresses.",

To test whether the TNS4 SH2 domain directly interacts with MET, and to map the MET pY residue(s) required for TNS4 association (Figure S2D), we employed an in vitro ELISA binding assay. Biotinylated MET phosphopeptides encompassing the juxtamembrane Y1003, the kinase domain Y1234-Y1235 (in combination), Y1313, the docking-site Y1349 and Y1356 (separately or in combination in one peptide), and Y1365 were tested for their ability to interact with recombinant GST-TNS4-SH2-PTB. MET peptides containing Y1003 and Y1365 demonstrated only residual binding to GST-TNS4-SH2-PTB. MET peptides encompassing Y1234-Y1235 and Y1349 exhibited intermediate binding, whereas peptides containing Y1313, Y1356, and the combination of Y1349 and Y1356 presented the strongest interaction with GST-TNS4-SH2-PTB (Figures 2F and 2G). We next compared a consensus pY recognition sequence reported for TNS4 SH2 domain binding with the MET phosphopeptide sequences and with a previously reported sequence of DLC-1 that also binds TNS4 SH2 domain. The results of our binding assays, i.e., the interaction affinity between MET and TNS4, correlated with the degree of sequence homology between the MET phosphopeptides and the consensus pY recognition motif reported for TNS4 SH2 domain (Figure 2H).",

Under salt stress, the calcium sensor SOS3 activates the kinase SOS2 that positively regulates SOS1, a plasma membrane sodium/proton antiporter. We show that SOS3 acts primarily in roots under salt stress. By contrast, the SOS3 homolog SOS3-LIKE CALCIUM BINDING PROTEIN8 (SCABP8)/CALCINEURIN B-LIKE10 functions mainly in the shoot response to salt toxicity. While root growth is reduced in sos3 mutants in the presence of NaCl, the salt sensitivity of scabp8 is more prominent in shoot tissues. SCABP8 is further shown to bind calcium, interact with SOS2 both in vitro and in vivo, recruit SOS2 to the plasma membrane, enhance SOS2 activity in a calcium-dependent manner, and activate SOS1 in yeast. In addition, sos3 scabp8 and sos2 scabp8 display a phenotype similar to sos2, which is more sensitive to salt than either sos3 or scabp8 alone. Overexpression of SCABP8 in sos3 partially rescues the sos3 salt-sensitive phenotype. However, overexpression of SOS3 fails to complement scabp8. These results suggest that SCABP8 and SOS3 are only partially redundant in their function, and each plays additional and unique roles in the plant salt stress response.",

This result supported earlier clinical studies in which statin reduced sd LDL-C levels in patients with diabetes mellitus or familial hypercholesterolemia. Both LDL reductions were largely explained by the increased expression of LDL receptors due to the decreased synthesis of intrahepatic cholesterol. Sd LDL particles have been shown to have a weaker affinity for the LDL receptor than large buoyant LDL, while the induction of the LDL receptor by statin reportedly stimulates the uptake of all LDL particles, irrespective of their size. Thus, the pitavastatin-induced expression of LDL receptors may have enhanced the hepatic uptake of sd LDL in addition to LDL, which subsequently led to reductions in both LDL-C and sd LDL-C levels.",

Methylation of histone tails plays an important role in chromatin structure and function. Previously, we reported that ESET/SETDB1 is a histone methyltransferase (HMTase). Here, we show that SETDB1 tightly associates with the human homolog of mAM, a murine ATFa-associated factor. Although recombinant ESET can methylate lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3-K9), its activity is severely compromised when compared to that of the ESET/mAM complex. mAM stimulates ESET enzymatic activity by increasing the Vmax and decreasing the Km. Importantly, mAM facilitates the ESET-dependent conversion of dimethyl H3-K9 to the trimethyl state both in vitro and in vivo. Chromatin-based transcription and ChIP analyses demonstrate that mAM enhances ESET-mediated transcriptional repression in a SAM-dependent manner, and this repression correlates with H3-K9 trimethylation at the promoter. Thus, our studies establish that promoter H3-K9 trimethylation is the cause of transcriptional repression and that mAM/hAM facilitates conversion of H3-K9 dimethyl to trimethyl by ESET/SETDB1.",

We decided to address this question by performing confocal microscopy. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect endogenous ADAT2 or ADAT3 by immunohistochemistry in human cell lines using commercially available antibodies so we chose to express fluorescently tagged proteins. To avoid misleading results, we cloned human ADAT2 and human ADAT3 as N-term or C-term fusion proteins with two different fluorophores: GFP and mCherry (eight constructs in total). By doing so, we could rule out potential localization artifacts due to the presence of a particular type of fluorophore or whether the fluorophore was fused to the N-term or the C-term of the protein. Additionally, expressing fluorescent proteins allowed us to perform live imaging, ruling out artifacts often observed by immunohistochemistry due to cell fixation protocols. As observed in Figure 3 (upper panel), GFP- or mCherry-tagged ADAT2 localized mainly to nucleus and partially to the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, GFP- or mCherry-tagged ADAT3 localized mainly to cytoplasm and only partially to nucleus (Figure 3 centre panel). Given that ADAT2 and ADAT3 are expected to work as a heterodimer, we thought that the localization might be dependent on the stoichiometry of the subunits. We therefore co-expressed GFP-tagged ADAT2 and mCherry-tagged ADAT3 and found both subunits co-localizing in nucleus (Figure 3 lower panel). Similar results were obtained with either combination of the eight different fluorescently-tagged proteins (Supplementary Figure S7). While it is nevertheless important to verify the subcellular localization of the endogenous ADAT2 and ADAT3; these results suggest that hetADAT acts mainly in nucleus and that ADAT3 translocates to nucleus in an ADAT2-dependent manner.",

We identified a conserved family of HIF prolyl hydoxylase (HPH) enzymes that appear to be responsible for this posttranslational modification. In cultured mammalian cells, inappropriate accumulation of HIF caused by forced expression of the HIF-1alpha subunit under normoxic conditions was attenuated by coexpression of HPH. Suppression of HPH in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells by RNA interference resulted in elevated expression of a hypoxia-inducible gene (LDH, encoding lactate dehydrogenase) under normoxic conditions.

Here we demonstrate that RXRalpha is a target substrate of a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-specific protease, SUSP1, which is capable of controlling the transcriptional activity of RXRalpha. RXRalpha was modified by SUMO-1 in vivo as well as in vitro, and the Lys-108 residue within the IKPP sequence of RXRalpha AF-1 domain was identified as the major SUMO-1 acceptor site. Prevention of SUMO modification by Lys-to-Arg mutation led to an increase not only in the transcriptional activity of RXRalpha but also in the activity of its heterodimeric complex with retinoic acid receptor-alpha or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). SUSP1 co-localized with RXRalpha in the nucleus and removed SUMO-1 from RXRalpha but not from androgen receptor or PPARgamma. Moreover, overexpression of SUSP1 caused an increase in the transcriptional activity of RXRalpha, whereas small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous SUSP1 led to a decrease in RXRalpha activity. These results suggest that SUSP1 plays an important role in the control of the transcriptional activity of RXRalpha and thus in the RXRalpha-mediated cellular processes.",

    "text": "Domain structure of the NRIF3 family of coregulators suggests potential dual roles in transcriptional regulation. \nThe identification of a novel coregulator for nuclear hormone receptors, designated NRIF3, was recently reported (D. Li et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 19:7191-7202, 1999). Unlike most known coactivators, NRIF3 exhibits a distinct receptor specificity in interacting with and potentiating the activity of only TRs and RXRs but not other examined nuclear receptors. However, the molecular basis underlying such specificity is unclear. In this report, we extended our study of NRIF3-receptor interactions. Our results suggest a bivalent interaction model, where a single NRIF3 molecule utilizes both the C-terminal LXXIL (receptor-interacting domain 1 [RID1]) and the N-terminal LXXLL (RID2) modules to cooperatively interact with TR or RXR (presumably a receptor dimer), with the spacing between RID1 and RID2 playing an important role in influencing the affinity of the interactions. During the course of these studies, we also uncovered an NRIF3-NRIF3 interaction domain. Deletion and mutagenesis analyses mapped the dimerization domain to a region in the middle of NRIF3 (residues 84 to 112), which is predicted to form a coiled-coil structure and contains a putative leucine zipper-like motif. By using Gal4 fusion constructs, we identified an autonomous transactivation domain (AD1) at the C terminus of NRIF3. Somewhat surprisingly, full-length NRIF3 fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 was found to repress transcription of a Gal4 reporter. Further analyses mapped a novel repression domain (RepD1) to a small region at the N-terminal portion of NRIF3 (residues 20 to 50). The NRIF3 gene encodes at least two additional isoforms due to alternative splicing. These two isoforms contain the same RepD1 region as NRIF3. Consistent with this, Gal4 fusions of these two isoforms were also found to repress transcription. Cotransfection of NRIF3 or its two isoforms did not relieve the transrepression function mediated by their corresponding Gal4 fusion proteins, suggesting that the repression involves a mechanism(s) other than the recruitment of a titratable corepressor. Interestingly, a single amino acid residue change of a potential phosphorylation site in RepD1 (Ser(28) to Ala) abolishes its transrepression function, suggesting that the coregulatory property of NRIF3 (or its isoforms) might be subjected to regulation by cellular signaling. Taken together, our results identify NRIF3 as an interesting coregulator that possesses both transactivation and transrepression domains and/or functions. Collectively, the NRIF3 family of coregulators (which includes NRIF3 and its other isoforms) may play dual roles in mediating both positive and negative regulatory effects on gene expression.",

    "text": "Recruitment of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex stabilizes the TNF-R1 signaling complex and is required for TNF-mediated gene induction.  TNF is a key inflammatory cytokine. Using a modified tandem affinity purification approach, we identified HOIL-1 and HOIP as functional components of the native TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC). Together, they were shown to form a linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) and to ubiquitylate NEMO. We show that LUBAC binds to ubiquitin chains of different linkage types and that its recruitment to the TNF-RSC is impaired in TRADD-, TRAF2-, and cIAP1/2- but not in RIP1- or NEMO-deficient MEFs. Furthermore, the E3 ligase activity of cIAPs, but not TRAF2, is required for HOIL-1 recruitment to the TNF-RSC. LUBAC enhances NEMO interaction with the TNF-RSC, stabilizes this protein complex, and is required for efficient TNF-induced activation of NF-kappaB and JNK, resulting in apoptosis inhibition. Finally, we demonstrate that sustained stability of the TNF-RSC requires LUBAC's enzymatic activity, thereby adding a third form of ubiquitin linkage to the triggering of TNF signaling by the TNF-RSC.",

    "text": "Human SHPRH is a ubiquitin ligase for Mms2-Ubc13-dependent polyubiquitylation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen.  Human SHPRH gene is located at the 6q24 chromosomal region, and loss of heterozygosity in this region is seen in a wide variety of cancers. SHPRH is a member of the SWI/SNF family of ATPases/helicases, and it possesses a C(3)HC(4) RING motif characteristic of ubiquitin ligase proteins. In both of these features, SHPRH resembles the yeast Rad5 protein, which, together with Mms2-Ubc13, promotes replication through DNA lesions via an error-free postreplicational repair pathway. Genetic evidence in yeast has indicated a role for Rad5 as a ubiquitin ligase in mediating the Mms2-Ubc13-dependent polyubiquitylation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Here we show that SHPRH is a functional homolog of Rad5. Similar to Rad5, SHPRH physically interacts with the Rad6-Rad18 and Mms2-Ubc13 complexes, and we show that SHPRH protein is a ubiquitin ligase indispensable for Mms2-Ubc13-dependent polyubiquitylation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Based on these observations, we predict a role for SHPRH in promoting error-free replication through DNA lesions. Such a role for SHPRH is consistent with the observation that this gene is mutated in a number of cancer cell lines, including those from melanomas and ovarian cancers, which raises the strong possibility that SHPRH function is an important deterrent to mutagenesis and carcinogenesis in humans.",

In this report, we investigate the mechanism of PIASy-mediated repression of AR. We show that AR binds to the RING-finger like domain of PIASy. PIASy contains two transcriptional repression domains, RD1 and RD2. RD1, but not RD2, is required for PIASy-mediated repression of AR. We show that the RD1 domain binds HDAC1 and HDAC2 and that HDAC activity is required for PIASy-mediated AR repression. PIAS proteins possess small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase activity. Conjugation of SUMO-1 to AR has been implicated in the regulation of AR activity. We examine if the SUMO ligase activity of PIASy is required for PIASy to repress AR. We show that a mutant PIASy, defective in promoting sumoylation, retains the ability to repress AR transcription. In addition, mutation of all the known sumoylation acceptor sites of AR does not affect the transrepression activity of PIASy on AR. Our results suggest that PIASy may repress AR by recruiting histone deacetylases, independent of its SUMO ligase activity.",

We have conducted high-resolution 4Pi fluorescence laser-scanning microscopy studies complemented with correlative electron microscopy and investigations of the accessibility of the PML-NB subcompartment. During interphase PML-NBs adopt a spherical organization characterized by the assembly of PML and Sp100 proteins into patches within a 50- to 100-nm-thick shell. This spherical shell of PML and Sp100 imposes little constraint to the exchange of components between the PML-NB interior and the nucleoplasm. Post-translational SUMO modifications, telomere repeats and heterochromatin protein 1 were found to localize in characteristic patterns with respect to PML and Sp100. From our findings, we derived a model that explains how the three-dimensional organization of PML-NBs serves to concentrate different biological activities while allowing for an efficient exchange of components.",

They have multisubunit modular structures in which substrate recognition and the catalysis of ubiquitination are carried out by distinct polypeptides. In a search for proteins involved in regulation of cullin-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases we immunopurified CUL4B-containing complex from HeLa cells and identified TIP120A as an associated protein by mass spectrometry. Immunoprecipitation of cullins revealed that all cullins tested specifically interacted with TIP120A. Reciprocal immunoaffinity purification of TIP120A confirmed the stable interaction of TIP120A with cullin family proteins. TIP120A formed a complex with CUL1 and Rbx1, but interfered with the binding of Skp1 and F-box proteins to CUL1. TIP120A greatly reduced the ubiquitination of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha by SCF(beta-TrCP) ubiquitin ligase. These results suggest that TIP120A functions as a negative regulator of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases and may modulate other cullin ligases in a similar fashion.",

When exposed to ionizing radiation (IR), eukaryotic cells activate checkpoint pathways to delay the progression of the cell cycle. Defects in the IR-induced S-phase checkpoint cause 'radioresistant DNA synthesis', a phenomenon that has been identified in cancer-prone patients suffering from ataxia-telangiectasia, a disease caused by mutations in the ATM gene. The Cdc25A phosphatase activates the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) needed for DNA synthesis, but becomes degraded in response to DNA damage or stalled replication. Here we report a functional link between ATM, the checkpoint signalling kinase Chk2/Cds1 (Chk2) and Cdc25A, and implicate this mechanism in controlling the S-phase checkpoint. We show that IR-induced destruction of Cdc25A requires both ATM and the Chk2-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc25A on serine 123. An IR-induced loss of Cdc25A protein prevents dephosphorylation of Cdk2 and leads to a transient blockade of DNA replication. We also show that tumour-associated Chk2 alleles cannot bind or phosphorylate Cdc25A, and that cells expressing these Chk2 alleles, elevated Cdc25A or a Cdk2 mutant unable to undergo inhibitory phosphorylation (Cdk2AF) fail to inhibit DNA synthesis when irradiated. These results support Chk2 as a candidate tumour suppressor, and identify the ATM-Chk2-Cdc25A-Cdk2 pathway as a genomic integrity checkpoint that prevents radioresistant DNA synthesis.",

Here, we report that the conserved bromo-domain of the transcriptional coactivator CBP (CREB binding protein) binds specifically to p53 at the C-terminal acetylated lysine 382. This bromodomain/acetyl-lysine binding is responsible for p53 acetylation-dependent coactivator recruitment after DNA damage, a step essential for p53-induced transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in G1 cell cycle arrest. We further present the three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the CBP bromodomain in complex with a lysine 382-acetylated p53 peptide.

This activity requires regions of SLP-76 that mediate protein-protein interactions with other molecules in T cells, suggesting that SLP-76-associated proteins also function to regulate signal transduction. Here we describe the molecular cloning of SLAP-130, a SLP-76-associated phosphoprotein of 130 kDa. We demonstrate that SLAP-130 is hematopoietic cell-specific and associates with the SH2 domain of SLP-76. Additionally, we show that SLAP-130 is a substrate of the T cell antigen receptor-induced protein tyrosine kinases. Interestingly, we find that in contrast to SLP-76, overexpression of SLAP-130 diminishes T cell antigen receptor-induced activation of the interleukin-2 promoter in Jurkat T cells and interferes with the augmentation of interleukin-2 promoter activity seen when SLP-76 is overexpressed in these cells. These data suggest that SLP-76 recruits a negative regulator, SLAP-130, as well as positive regulators of signal transduction in T cells.",

    "text": "The E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP1 selectively targets HER4 and its proteolytically derived signaling isoforms for degradation.  In general, epidermal growth factor receptor family members stimulate cell proliferation. In contrast, at least one HER4 isoform, JM-a/Cyt1, inhibits cell growth after undergoing a two-step proteolytic cleavage that first produces a membrane-anchored 80-kDa fragment (m80(HER4)) and subsequently liberates a soluble 80-kDa fragment, s80(HER4). Here we report that s80(HER4) Cyt1 action increased the expression of WWP1 (for WW domain-containing protein 1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, but not other members of the Nedd4 E3 ligase family. The HER4 Cyt1 isoform contains three proline-rich tyrosine (PY) WW binding motifs, while Cyt2 has only two. WWP1 binds to all three Cyt1 PY motifs; the interaction with PY2 found exclusively in Cyt1 was strongest. WWP1 ubiquitinated and caused the degradation of HER4 but not of EGFR, HER2, or HER3. The HER4-WWP1 interaction also accelerated WWP1 degradation. Membrane HER4 (full length and m80(HER4), the product of the first proteolytic cleavage) were the preferred targets of WWP1, correlating with the membrane localization of WWP1. Conversely s80(HER4), a poorer WWP1 substrate, was found in the cell nucleus, while WWP1 was not. Deletion of the C2 membrane association domain of WWP1 allowed more efficient s80(HER4) degradation, suggesting that WWP1 is normally part of a membrane complex that regulates HER4 membrane species levels, with a predilection for the growth-inhibitory Cyt1 isoform. Finally, WWP1 expression diminished HER4 biologic activity in MCF-7 cells. We previously showed that nuclear s80(HER4) is ubiquitinated and degraded by the anaphase-promoting complex, suggesting that HER4 ubiquitination within specific cellular compartments helps regulate the unique HER4 signaling capabilities.",

    "text": "CDC28 phosphorylates Cac1p and regulates the association of chromatin assembly factor I with chromatin. \nChromatin Assembly Factor I (CAF-I) plays a key role in the replication-coupled assembly of nucleosomes. It is expected that its function is linked to the regulation of the cell cycle, but little detail is available. Current models suggest that CAF-I is recruited to replication forks and to chromatin via an interaction between its Cac1p subunit and the replication sliding clamp, PCNA, and that this interaction is stimulated by the kinase CDC7. Here we show that another kinase, CDC28, phosphorylates Cac1p on serines 94 and 515 in early S phase and regulates its association with chromatin, but not its association with PCNA. Mutations in the Cac1p-phosphorylation sites of CDC28 but not of CDC7 substantially reduce the in vivo phosphorylation of Cac1p. However, mutations in the putative CDC7 target sites on Cac1p reduce its stability. The association of CAF-I with chromatin is impaired in a cdc28-1 mutant and to a lesser extent in a cdc7-1 mutant. In addition, mutations in the Cac1p-phosphorylation sites by both CDC28 and CDC7 reduce gene silencing at the telomeres. We propose that this phosphorylation represents a regulatory step in the recruitment of CAF-I to chromatin in early S phase that is distinct from the association of CAF-I with PCNA. Hence, we implicate CDC28 in the regulation of chromatin reassembly during DNA replication. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights on the links between cell-cycle regulation, DNA replication and chromatin reassembly.",

Drosophila melanogaster oocyte chromosomes have a major role in nucleating microtubules, which precedes the bundling and assembly of these microtubules into a bipolar spindle. Here we present evidence that a region similar to the anaphase central spindle functions to organize acentrosomal spindles. Subito mutants are characterized by the formation of tripolar or monopolar spindles and nondisjunction of homologous chromosomes at meiosis I. Subito encodes a kinesinlike protein and associates with the meiotic central spindle, consistent with its classification in the Kinesin 6/MKLP1 family. This class of proteins is known to be required for cytokinesis, but our results suggest a new function in spindle formation. The meiotic central spindle appears during prometaphase and includes passenger complex proteins such as AurB and Incenp. Unlike mitotic cells, the passenger proteins do not associate with centromeres before anaphase. In the absence of Subito, central spindle formation is defective and AurB and Incenp fail to properly localize. We propose that Subito is required for establishing and/or maintaining the central spindle in Drosophila oocytes, and this substitutes for the role of centrosomes in organizing the bipolar spindle.",

Two of the three RhoBTB proteins, RhoBTB1 and RhoBTB2, have been proposed as tumor suppressors and might function as adaptors of Cul3-dependent ubiquitin ligase complexes. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation we show that all three RhoBTB proteins interact with Cul3. The interaction requires the N-terminal region of Cul3 and the first BTB domain of RhoBTB. RhoBTB3, the only RhoBTB with a prenylation motif, associates with vesicles that are frequently found in the vicinity of microtubules, suggesting a participation in some aspects of vesicle trafficking. We also show that RhoBTB2 and RhoBTB3 are capable of homo and heterodimerizing through the BTB domain region. The GTPase domain, which does not bind GTP, is able to interact with the BTB domain region, thus preventing proteasomal degradation of RhoBTB. This fits into a model in which an intramolecular interaction maintains RhoBTB in an inactive state, preventing the formation or the functionality of Cul3-dependent complexes. We also report a significantly decreased expression of RHOBTB and CUL3 genes in kidney and breast tumor samples and a very good correlation in the expression changes between RHOBTB and CUL3 that suggests that these genes are subject to a common inactivation mechanism in tumors.",

Here we report the crystal structures of TRAF6 and its complex with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) Ubc13. The RING and zinc fingers of TRAF6 assume a rigid, elongated structure. Interaction of TRAF6 with Ubc13 involves direct contacts of the RING and the preceding residues, and the first zinc finger has a structural role. Unexpectedly, this region of TRAF6 is dimeric both in the crystal and in solution, different from the trimeric C-terminal TRAF domain. Structure-based mutagenesis reveals that TRAF6 dimerization is crucial for polyubiquitin synthesis and autoubiquitination. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis shows that TRAF6 dimerization induces higher-order oligomerization of full-length TRAF6. The mismatch of dimeric and trimeric symmetry may provide a mode of infinite oligomerization that facilitates ligand-dependent signal transduction of many immune receptors.",

However, the exact mechanisms by which it regulates this transport route remain largely unknown. In this paper, we show that COG interacts directly with the target membrane SNARE (t-SNARE) Syntaxin 6 via the Cog6 subunit. In Cog6-depleted cells, the steady-state level of Syntaxin 6 was markedly reduced, and concomitantly, endosome-to-TGN retrograde traffic was significantly attenuated. Cog6 knockdown also affected the steady-state levels and/or subcellular distributions of Syntaxin 16, Vti1a, and VAMP4 and impaired the assembly of the Syntaxin 6-Syntaxin16-Vti1a-VAMP4 SNARE complex. Remarkably, overexpression of VAMP4, but not of Syntaxin 6, bypassed the requirement for COG and restored endosome-to-TGN trafficking in Cog6-depleted cells. These results suggest that COG directly interacts with specific t-SNAREs and positively regulates SNARE complex assembly, thereby affecting their associated trafficking steps.",

    "text": "How can the seemingly contradictory evidence for initiation of NMD by decapping and deadenylation versus endonucleolytic cleavage in human cells be reconciled? The simplest hypothesis is that after PTC recognition, a transcript can be subjected to either degradation route: it is either degraded through the \"normal\" mRNA turnover pathway starting with deadenylation and/or decapping or through endonucleolytic cleavage. In either case, this is followed by exonucleolytic decay of the resulting RNA fragments from the unprotected ends (Fig. 1). If so, what determines which pathway is activated? Interestingly, SMG5, SMG6 and SMG7 are all proteins of similar structure that, at least in part, interact through 14-3-3-like domains with the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of UPF1. However, whereas the PIN domain of SMG6 possesses endonuclease activity, the PIN domain of SMG5 lacks important catalytic residues and SMG7 has no PIN domain at all. SMG7 on the other hand activates mRNA decay in a DCP2- and XRN1-dependent manner, but independently of SMG6, when tethered to a reporter mRNA. Is it possible that the identity of the SMG5-7 protein(s) recruited to the NMD complex determines the mechanism of decay? This idea may explain why in flies, which lack a paralog of SMG7, NMD appears to rely on SMG6-mediated endocleavage, whereas in yeast, which lack SMG6 but possess Ebs1p, a protein homologous to SMG7, NMD initiates by decapping and deadenylation.",

Lysyl hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.4), an alpha 2 dimer, catalyzes the formation of hydroxylysine in collagens by the hydroxylation of lysine residues in peptide linkages. A deficiency in this enzyme activity is known to exist in patients with the type VI variant of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but no amino acid sequence data have been available for the wildtype or mutated human enzyme from any source. We report the isolation and characterization of cDNA clones for lysyl hydroxylase from a human placenta lambda gt11 cDNA library. The cDNA clones cover almost all of the 3.2-kb mRNA, including all the coding sequences. These clones encode a polypeptide of 709 amino acid residues and a signal peptide of 18 amino acids. The human coding sequences are 72% identical to the recently reported chick sequences at the nucleotide level and 76% identical at the amino acid level. The C-terminal region is especially well conserved, a 139-amino-acid region, residues 588-727 (C-terminus), being 94% identical between the two species and a 76-amino-acid region, residues 639-715, 99% identical. These comparisons, together with other recent data, suggest that lysyl hydroxylase may contain functionally significant sequences especially in its C-terminal region. The human lysyl hydroxylase gene (PLOD) was mapped to chromosome 1 by Southern blot analysis of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids, to the 1p34----1pter region by using cell hybrids that contain various translocations of human chromosome 1, and by in situ hybridization to 1p36.2----1p36.3. This gene is thus not physically linked to those for the alpha and beta subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, which are located on chromosomes 10 and 17, respectively.",

Here we identify a polyglycylase in the TTLL proteins by using an anti-poly-glycine antibody. The antibody reacted with a cytoplasmic 60-kDa protein that accumulated in elongating spermatids. Using tandem mass spectrometry of trypsinized samples, immunoprecipitated by the antibody from the TTLL10-expressing cells, we identified the 60-kDa protein as nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1). Recombinant TTLL10 incorporated glycine into recombinant NAP1 in vitro. Mutational analyses indicated that Glu residues at 359 and 360 in the C-terminal part of NAP1 are putative sites for the modification. Thus, TTLL10 is a polyglycylase for NAP1.",

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis reveals defective splicing of the chk1(+) transcript at the nonpermissive temperature. Apart from chk1(+), the splicing of some other genes were also found to be defective at the nonpermissive temperature suggesting that Rna14 might be involved in pre-mRNA splicing.

To explore the mechanism underlying the differential mismatch recognition by these two proteins, purified human MutSalpha and MutSbeta were analyzed individually and competitively for their abilities to interact with a T-G and an ID substrate. We show that MutSalpha has K(D) values of 26.5 and 38.2 nm for the G-T and ID substrates, respectively, and that MutSbeta has K(D) values of 76.5 and 23.5 nm for G-T and ID, respectively. Consistent with these results, competitive binding assays revealed the following relative binding affinities: MutSbeta-ID > MutSalpha-T-G > MutSalpha-ID >> MutSbeta-T-G. Interestingly, binding of MutSbeta to ID heteroduplexes is greatly stimulated when the MutSalpha:MutSbeta ratio is > or = 10. Distinct ATP/ADP binding and ATPase activities of MutSalpha and MutSbeta were also observed. In the absence of DNA, ADP binding and ATPase activities of MutSbeta are significantly higher than those of MutSalpha. However, interaction with DNA significantly stimulates the MutSalpha ATPase activity and reduces the MutSbeta ATPase activity, the consequence being that both proteins exhibit the same level of hydrolytic activity. We conclude that the preferential processing of base-base and ID heteroduplexes by MutSalpha and MutSbeta is determined by their significant differences in ATPase activity, ADP binding activity, and high cellular MutSalpha:MutSbeta ratio.",

TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6) is a RING (really interesting new gene) domain ubiquitin (Ub) ligase that mediates the activation of protein kinases, such as transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and IkappaB kinase (IKK), by catalyzing the formation of a unique polyubiquitin chain linked through Lys-63 of Ub. Here, we present evidence that TIFA (TRAF-interacting protein with a forkhead-associated domain, also known as T2BP) activates IKK by promoting the oligomerization and Ub ligase activity of TRAF6. We show that recombinant TIFA protein, but not TRAF6-binding-defective mutant, can activate IKK in crude cytosolic extracts. Furthermore, TIFA activates IKK in an in vitro reconstitution system consisting of purified proteins, including TRAF6, the TAK1 kinase complex, and Ub-conjugating enzyme complex Ubc13-Uev1A. Interestingly, a fraction of recombinant TIFA protein exists as high-molecular-weight oligomers, and only these oligomeric forms of TIFA can activate IKK. Importantly, TIFA induces the oligomerization and polyubiquitination of TRAF6, which leads to the activation of TAK1 and IKK through a proteasome-independent mechanism.",

We have also purified a p53 target protein in the deacetylase complexes (designated PID; but identical to metastasis-associated protein 2 (MTA2)), which has been identified as a component of the NuRD complex. PID specifically interacts with p53 both in vitro and in vivo, and its expression reduces significantly the steady-state levels of acetylated p53. PID expression strongly represses p53-dependent transcriptional activation, and, notably, it modulates p53-mediated cell growth arrest and apoptosis.

'Knockdown' of SGT1 by small interfering RNA or chemical inhibition of HSP90 abrogated inflammasome activity, and inhibition of HSP90 blocked Nod2-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and reduced NALP3-mediated gout-like inflammation in mice. Our data demonstrate a similarity in one type of innate immunity in plants and mammals that is consistent with convergent evolution of a shared mechanism.",

The POU domain of Brn-3b which interacts with the ER was sufficient to confer this activation potential, and the change of a single amino acid in the first helix of the POU homeodomain of Brn-3a to its equivalent in Brn-3b can change the mild repressive effect of Brn-3a to a stimulatory Brn-3b-like effect.

Pretreatment of cells with rapamycin, an allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor, or Torin1, an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, did not prevent the amino acid-induced decrease in the GATOR2-Sestrin2 interaction, indicating that mTORC1 activity does not control the interaction (Figure S1C). Consistent with the notion that the pathways upstream of mTORC1 that sense amino acids and growth factors are largely independent, insulin treatment of cells did not regulate the Sestrin2-GATOR2 interaction (Figure 1E). Interestingly, however, glucose deprivation led to a modest increase in the amount of Sestrin2 bound to GATOR2, albeit to a much lesser extent than that caused by amino acid starvation (Figure 1E).

Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells (AC) by professional phagocytes is crucial for tissue homeostasis and resolution of inflammation. Macrophages respond to AC with an increase in antiinflammatory cytokine production but a diminished release of proinflammatory mediators. Mechanisms to explain attenuated proinflammatory cytokine formation remain elusive. We provide evidence that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coordinates antiinflammatory responses following its activation by AC. Exposing murine RAW264.7 macrophages to AC before LPS stimulation reduced NF-kappaB transactivation and lowered target gene expression of, that is, TNF-alpha and IL-6 compared with controls. In macrophages overexpressing a dominant negative mutant of PPARgamma, NF-kappaB transactivation in response to LPS was restored, while macrophages from myeloid lineage-specific conditional PPARgamma knockout mice proved that PPARgamma transmitted an antiinflammatory response, which was delivered by AC. Expressing a PPARgamma-Delta aa32-250 deletion mutant, we observed no inhibition of NF-kappaB. Analyzing the PPARgamma domain structures within aa 32-250, we anticipated PPARgamma sumoylation in mediating the antiinflammatory effect in response to AC. Interfering with sumoylation of PPARgamma by mutating the predicted sumoylation site (K77R), or knockdown of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT1), eliminated the ability of AC to suppress NF-kappaB. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that AC prevented the LPS-induced removal of nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) from the kappaB site within the TNF-alpha promoter. We conclude that AC induce PPARgamma sumoylation to attenuate the removal of NCoR, thereby blocking transactivation of NF-kappaB. This contributes to an antiinflammatory phenotype shift in macrophages responding to AC by lowering proinflammatory cytokine production.",

Despite lacking a transmembrane segment, Numb is associated with the cell membrane during the asymmetric cell division of Drosophila neural precursor cells and is selectively partitioned to one of the two progeny cells from a binary cell division. Numb contains an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain that is essential for both the asymmetric localization and the fate specification function of Numb. We report here the isolation and characterization of a novel PTB domain-binding protein, NIP (Numb-interacting protein). NIP is a multipass transmembrane protein that contains two PTB domain-binding, NXXF motifs required for the interaction with Numb. In dividing Drosophila neuroblasts, NIP is colocalized to the cell membrane with Numb in a basal cortical crescent. Expression of NIP in Cos-7 cells recruited Numb from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. This recruitment of Numb to membrane by NIP was dependent on the presence of at least one NXXF site. In Drosophila Schneider 2 cells, NIP and Numb were colocalized at the plasma membrane. Inhibition of NIP expression by RNA interference released Numb to the cytosol. These results suggest that a direct protein-protein interaction between NIP and Numb is necessary and sufficient for the recruitment of Numb to the plasma membrane. Recruitment of Numb to a basal cortical crescent in a dividing neuroblast is essential for Numb to function as an intrinsic cell fate determinant.",

    "text": "Molecular mechanism of APC/C activation by mitotic phosphorylation. \nIn eukaryotes, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C, also known as the cyclosome) regulates the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of specific cell-cycle proteins to coordinate chromosome segregation in mitosis and entry into the G1 phase. The catalytic activity of the APC/C and its ability to specify the destruction of particular proteins at different phases of the cell cycle are controlled by its interaction with two structurally related coactivator subunits, Cdc20 and Cdh1. Coactivators recognize substrate degrons, and enhance the affinity of the APC/C for its cognate E2 (refs 4-6). During mitosis, cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) and polo-like kinase (Plk) control Cdc20- and Cdh1-mediated activation of the APC/C. Hyperphosphorylation of APC/C subunits, notably Apc1 and Apc3, is required for Cdc20 to activate the APC/C, whereas phosphorylation of Cdh1 prevents its association with the APC/C. Since both coactivators associate with the APC/C through their common C-box and Ile-Arg tail motifs, the mechanism underlying this differential regulation is unclear, as is the role of specific APC/C phosphorylation sites. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical analysis, we define the molecular basis of how phosphorylation of human APC/C allows for its control by Cdc20. An auto-inhibitory segment of Apc1 acts as a molecular switch that in apo unphosphorylated APC/C interacts with the C-box binding site and obstructs engagement of Cdc20. Phosphorylation of the auto-inhibitory segment displaces it from the C-box-binding site. Efficient phosphorylation of the auto-inhibitory segment, and thus relief of auto-inhibition, requires the recruitment of Cdk-cyclin in complex with a Cdk regulatory subunit (Cks) to a hyperphosphorylated loop of Apc3. We also find that the small-molecule inhibitor, tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, preferentially suppresses APC/C(Cdc20) rather than APC/C(Cdh1), and interacts with the binding sites of both the C-box and Ile-Arg tail motifs. Our results reveal the mechanism for the regulation of mitotic APC/C by phosphorylation and provide a rationale for the development of selective inhibitors of this state.",

Nedd8 activates ubiquitination by increasing the efficiency of polyubiquitin chain assembly through its covalent conjugation to cullin molecules. Here we report the isolation, cloning, and characterization of a novel human Nedd8-specific protease called DEN1. Human DEN1 is encoded by AAH31411.1, a previously uncharacterized protein of 212 amino acids that shares homology with the Ulp1 cysteinyl SUMO deconjugating enzyme family. Recombinant human DEN1, purified from bacteria, selectively binds to Nedd8 and hydrolyzes C-terminal derivatives of Nedd8. Interestingly, DEN1 deconjugates cullin 1 (CUL1)-Nedd8 in a concentration-dependent manner. At a low concentration, DEN1 processes hyper-neddylated CUL1 to yield a mononeddylated form, which presumably contains the Lys-720CUL1-Nedd8 linkage. At elevated concentrations, DEN1 is able to complete the removal of Nedd8 from CUL1. These activities distinguish DEN1 from the COP9 signalosome, which is capable of efficiently cleaving the Lys-720CUL1-Nedd8 conjugate, but lacks Nedd8 C-terminal hydrolytic activity and poorly processes hyperneddylated CUL1. These results suggest a unique role for DEN1 in regulating the modification of cullins by Nedd8.",

    "text": "A novel phosphatidic acid-selective phospholipase A1 that produces lysophosphatidic acid.  \nLysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a lipid mediator with diverse biological properties, although its synthetic pathways have not been completely solved. We report the cloning and characterization of a novel phosphatidic acid (PA)-selective phospholipase A(1) (PLA(1)) that produces 2-acyl-LPA. The PLA(1) was identified in the GenBank(TM) data base as a close homologue of phosphatidylserine (PS)-specific PLA(1) (PS-PLA(1)). When expressed in insect Sf9 cells, this enzyme was recovered from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction and did not show any catalytic activity toward exogenously added phospholipid substrates. However, culture medium obtained from Sf9 cells expressing the enzyme was found to activate EDG7/LPA(3), a cellular receptor for 2-acyl-LPA. The activation of EDG7 was further enhanced when the cells were treated with phorbol ester or a bacterial phospholipase D, suggesting involvement of phospholipase D in the process. In the latter condition, an increased level of LPA, but not other lysophospholipids, was confirmed by mass spectrometry analyses. Expression of the enzyme is observed in several human tissues such as prostate, testis, ovary, pancreas, and especially platelets. These data show that the enzyme is a membrane-associated PA-selective PLA(1) and suggest that it has a role in LPA production.",

These products include cholesterol and several nonsterol isoprenoids. The isoprenoid farnesyl is a particularly important intermediate in the mevalonate pathway. Farnesyl can be used to synthesize cholesterol and can also bind covalently to several low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins such as p21 ras. Farnesylated p21 ras may be critical for mitogenic signalling stimulated by growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor. Inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, such as lovastatin and compactin, block the production of mevalonate and its metabolites. These agents have been shown to inhibit proliferation of many cell types. Recently we demonstrated that lovastatin inhibited proliferation of cultured glomerular mesangial cells. Lovastatin inhibition was overcome by the simultaneous addition of either mevalonate or farnesol, but not by exogenous low density lipoprotein cholesterol. These results suggested that farnesyl is critical for mesangial cell proliferation. In several experimental models of renal disease, chronic lovastatin administration reduced the extent of glomerular injury. The beneficial effects of lovastatin have been attributed to lowering of circulating lipid and lipoprotein levels. In view of recent data, however, it is possible that lovastatin may act to reduce glomerular injury, at least in part, through a direct action on mesangial cell proliferation.",

Its regulatory myosin-binding subunit, MBS, is responsible for regulating the catalytic subunit in response to upstream signals and for determining the substrate specificity. DMBS, the Drosophila homolog of MBS, was identified to study the roles of myosin phosphatase in morphogenesis. The embryos defective for both maternal and zygotic DMBS demonstrated a failure in dorsal closure. In the mutant embryos, the defects were mainly confined to the leading edge cells which failed to fully elongate. Ectopic accumulation of phosphorylated MRLC was detected in lateral region of the leading edge cells, suggesting that the role of DMBS is to repress the activation of nonmuscle myosin II at the subcellular location for coordinated cell shape change. Aberrant accumulation of F-actin within the leading edge cells may correspond to the morphological aberrations of such cells. Similar defects were seen in embryos overexpressing Rho-kinase, suggesting that myosin phosphatase and Rho-kinase function antagonistically. The genetic interaction of DMBS with mutations in the components of the Rho signaling cascade also indicates that DMBS functions antagonistically to the Rho signal transduction pathway. The results indicate an important role for myosin phosphatase in morphogenesis.",

This enzyme resides on the cytoplasmic aspect of the Golgi apparatus and in caveolae and is dually acylated by both N-myristoylation and S-palmitoylation. Palmitoylation-deficient mutants of eNOS release less nitric oxide (NO). We identify enzymes that palmitoylate eNOS in vivo. Transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with the complementary DNA (cDNA) for eNOS and 23 cDNA clones encoding the Asp-His-His-Cys motif (DHHC) palmitoyl transferase family members showed that five clones (2, 3, 7, 8, and 21) enhanced incorporation of [3H]-palmitate into eNOS. Human endothelial cells express all five of these enzymes, which colocalize with eNOS in the Golgi and plasma membrane and interact with eNOS. Importantly, inhibition of DHHC-21 palmitoyl transferase, but not DHHC-3, in human endothelial cells reduces eNOS palmitoylation, eNOS targeting, and stimulated NO production. Collectively, our data describe five new Golgi-targeted DHHC enzymes in human endothelial cells and suggest a regulatory role of DHHC-21 in governing eNOS localization and function.",

Remodelling of the nuclear membrane is essential for the dynamic changes of nuclear architecture at different stages of the cell cycle and during cell differentiation. The molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of nuclear membrane biogenesis is not known. Here we show that Smp2, the yeast homologue of mammalian lipin, is a key regulator of nuclear membrane growth during the cell cycle. Smp2 is phosphorylated by Cdc28/Cdk1 and dephosphorylated by a nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-localized CPD phosphatase complex consisting of Nem1 and Spo7. Loss of either SMP2 or its dephosphorylated form causes transcriptional upregulation of key enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis concurrent with a massive expansion of the nucleus. Conversely, constitutive dephosphorylation of Smp2 inhibits cell division. We show that Smp2 associates with the promoters of phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes in a Nem1-Spo7-dependent manner. Our data suggest that Smp2 is a critical factor in coordinating phospholipid biosynthesis at the nuclear/ER membrane with nuclear growth during the cell cycle.",

To clarify the capability of Fra-1 in activating transcription of MMP-9 gene, we analyzed the transcriptional activity of the MMP-9 promoter through the measure of luciferase activities in the MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with Fra-1. The positive regulation of Fra-1 on MMP-9 promoter was not detectable. By the analysis of MMP-9 promoter, a potential Stat3 binding site, just juxtaposed AP-1 consensus sequence, was noticed. The reporter assay showed that MMP-9 promoter was activated remarkably by cotransfection with Fra-1 and Stat3C. DNA affinity precipitation assay confirmed the binding of Stat3 and Fra-1 to the elements of MMP-9 promoter and also revealed c-Jun recruited to Stat3-Fra-1 complex. By immunoprecipitation assay, the Stat3/Fra-1, Stat3/c-Jun and Fra-1/c-Jun complexes were identified in vivo. Our study demonstrated that the activation of MMP-9 promoter is dependent upon interactions of Fra-1/c-Jun with Stat3.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which presenilins regulate these processes remain unknown. With regard to the latter, we describe a molecular link between presenilins and the apoptotic pathway. Bcl-X(L), an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family was shown to interact with the carboxyl-terminal fragments of PS1 and PS2 by the yeast two-hybrid system. In vivo interaction analysis revealed that both PS2 and its naturally occurring carboxyl-terminal products, PS2short and PS2Ccas, associated with Bcl-X(L), whereas the caspase-3-generated amino-terminal PS2Ncas fragment did not. This interaction was corroborated by demonstrating that Bcl-X(L) and PS2 partially co-localized to sites of the vesicular transport system. Functional analysis revealed that presenilins can influence mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic activities, such as cytochrome c release and Bax-mediated apoptosis. Together, these data support a possible role of the Alzheimer's presenilins in modulating the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-X(L).",

    "text": "An interesting property of plakoglobin is that it binds to both classical and desmosomal cadherins. The observation that DP-NTP binds to plakoglobin and clusters desmosomal cadherin-plakoglobin complexes implies that desmoplakin binds to plakoglobin that is associated with the desmosomal cadherin cytoplasmic domain. In contrast, plakoglobin that is associated with the desmosomal cadherin cytoplasmic domain is unable to bind to alpha-catenin (Fig. 8). Recent studies have demonstrated that the alpha-catenin and Dsg1 binding sites on plakoglobin overlap in the amino-terminal armadillo repeats of plakoglobin, suggesting that Dsg1 and alpha-catenin cannot bind to the same plakoglobin molecule simultaneously. However, the classical cadherins bind to the central armadillo repeats of plakoglobin, leaving the amino-terminal armadillo repeats of plakoglobin available to bind alpha-catenin. In the present study, deletion mutants of plakoglobin lacking either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal domain co-immunoprecipitated with DP-NTP and were clustered in L-cells co-expressing DP-NTP. These results, along with the ability of the amino-terminal plakoglobin deletion to interact with DP-NTP in the two hybrid system, suggest that desmoplakin may bind to the central armadillo repeats of plakoglobin. In A431 cells, the expression of plakoglobin deletion mutants lacking the amino- and carboxyl-terminal end domains promoted the assembly of elongated and fused desmosomes, suggesting that the central armadillo repeats of plakoglobin can promote interactions between desmosomal proteins, which may include desmoplakin. Future studies will be directed at mapping precisely where desmoplakin binds to plakoglobin in relation to the sites on plakoglobin that bind to the desmosomal cadherins. Such studies should provide insight into the mechanisms by which the cadherin cytoplasmic tails govern the domains on plakoglobin that are available for interactions with either alpha-catenin or desmoplakin.",

    "text": "Differential regulation of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein by G(1) cyclin-dependent kinase complexes in vivo.  \nThe retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) negatively regulates early-G(1) cell cycle progression, in part, by sequestering E2F transcription factors and repressing E2F-responsive genes. Although pRB is phosphorylated on up to 16 cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) sites by multiple G(1) cyclin-Cdk complexes, the active form(s) of pRB in vivo remains unknown. pRB is present as an unphosphorylated protein in G(0) quiescent cells and becomes hypophosphorylated (approximately 2 mol of PO(4) to 1 mol of pRB) in early G(1) and hyperphosphorylated (approximately 10 mol of PO(4) to 1 mol of pRB) in late G(1) phase. Here, we report that hypophosphorylated pRB, present in early G(1), represents the biologically active form of pRB in vivo that is assembled with E2Fs and E1A but that both unphosphorylated pRB in G(0) and hyperphosphorylated pRB in late G(1) fail to become assembled with E2Fs and E1A. Furthermore, using transducible dominant-negative TAT fusion proteins that differentially target cyclin D-Cdk4 or cyclin D-Cdk6 (cyclin D-Cdk4/6) and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes, namely, TAT-p16 and TAT-dominant-negative Cdk2, respectively, we found that, in vivo, cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes hypophosphorylate pRB in early G(1) and that cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes inactivate pRB by hyperphosphorylation in late G(1). Moreover, we found that cycling human tumor cells expressing deregulated cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes, due to deletion of the p16(INK4a) gene, contained hypophosphorylated pRB that was bound to E2Fs in early G(1) and that E2F-responsive genes, including those for dihydrofolate reductase and cyclin E, were transcriptionally repressed. Thus, we conclude that, physiologically, pRB is differentially regulated by G(1) cyclin-Cdk complexes.",

Histone lysine methylation is a central modification to mark functionally distinct chromatin regions. In particular, H3-K9 trimethylation has emerged as a hallmark of pericentric heterochromatin in mammals. Here we show that H4-K20 trimethylation is also focally enriched at pericentric heterochromatin. Intriguingly, H3-K9 trimethylation by the Suv39h HMTases is required for the induction of H4-K20 trimethylation, although the H4 Lys 20 position is not an intrinsic substrate for these enzymes. By using a candidate approach, we identified Suv4-20h1 and Suv4-20h2 as two novel SET domain HMTases that localize to pericentric heterochromatin and specifically act as nucleosomal H4-K20 trimethylating enzymes. Interaction of the Suv4-20h enzymes with HP1 isoforms suggests a sequential mechanism to establish H3-K9 and H4-K20 trimethylation at pericentric heterochromatin. Heterochromatic H4-K20 trimethylation is evolutionarily conserved, and in Drosophila, the Suv4-20 homolog is a novel PEV modifier to regulate position-effect variegation. Together, our data indicate a function for H4-K20 trimethylation in gene silencing and further suggest H3-K9 and H4-K20 trimethylation as important components of a repressive pathway that can index pericentric heterochromatin.",

DNA methylation in mammals is highly dynamic during germ cell and preimplantation development but is relatively static during the development of somatic tissues. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), created by oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by Tet proteins and most abundant in the brain, is thought to be an intermediary toward 5mC demethylation. We investigated patterns of 5mC and 5hmC during neurogenesis in the embryonic mouse brain. 5hmC levels increase during neuronal differentiation. In neuronal cells, 5hmC is not enriched at enhancers but associates preferentially with gene bodies of activated neuronal function-related genes. Within these genes, gain of 5hmC is often accompanied by loss of H3K27me3. Enrichment of 5hmC is not associated with substantial DNA demethylation, suggesting that 5hmC is a stable epigenetic mark. Functional perturbation of the H3K27 methyltransferase Ezh2 or of Tet2 and Tet3 leads to defects in neuronal differentiation, suggesting that formation of 5hmC and loss of H3K27me3 cooperate to promote brain development.",

    "text": "Acetylation in nuclear receptor signaling and the role of sirtuins. \nIt has been known since the early 1970s that nuclear receptor complexes bind DNA in association with coregulatory proteins. Characterization of these nuclear receptor coregulators has revealed diverse enzymatic activities that temporally and spatially coordinate nuclear receptor activity within the context of local chromatin in response to diverse hormone signals. Chromatin-modifying proteins, which dictate the higher-order chromatin structure in which DNA is packaged, in turn orchestrate orderly recruitment of nuclear receptor complexes. Modifications of histones include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation, ADP ribosylation, deimination, and proline isomerization. At this time, we understand how a subset of these modifications regulates nuclear receptor signaling. However, the effects, particularly of acetylation and demethylation, are profound. The finding that nuclear receptors are directly acetylated and that acetylation in turn directly regulates contact-independent growth has broad therapeutic implications. Studies over the past 7 yr have led to the understanding that nuclear receptor acetylation is a conserved function, regulating diverse nuclear receptor activity. Furthermore, we now know that acetylation of multiple and distinct substrates within nuclear receptor signaling pathways, form an acetylation signaling network from the cell surface to the nucleus. The finding that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent histone deacetylases, the sirtuins, are capable of deacetylating nuclear receptors provides a new level of complexity in the control of nuclear receptor activity in which local intracellular concentrations of NAD may regulate nuclear receptor physiology.",

While the extent of histone acetylation is determined by both acetyltransferases and deacetylases, it has been unclear whether histone methylation is also regulated by enzymes with opposing activities. Here, we provide evidence that LSD1 (KIAA0601), a nuclear homolog of amine oxidases, functions as a histone demethylase and transcriptional corepressor. LSD1 specifically demethylates histone H3 lysine 4, which is linked to active transcription. Lysine demethylation occurs via an oxidation reaction that generates formaldehyde. Importantly, RNAi inhibition of LSD1 causes an increase in H3 lysine 4 methylation and concomitant derepression of target genes, suggesting that LSD1 represses transcription via histone demethylation. The results thus identify a histone demethylase conserved from S. pombe to human and reveal dynamic regulation of histone methylation by both histone methylases and demethylases.",

    "text": "Based on the observation of dimerized Y288C protein in the Golgi and ER (Fig. 3d), we further investigated the activity of Y288C protein in those two compartments by assessing phosphorylation of Y288C proteins in OptiPrep gradient fractions. Surprisingly, Y288C protein displayed a differential phosphorylation pattern in those two compartments. p-PDGFRA Y572/574 and Y742 were predominantly detected in the Golgi enriched fractions and p-PDGFRA Y720, Y754, and Y1018 were found in both Golgi and ER-enriched fractions (Fig. 4a). Tyrosine phosphorylation of these sites recruits different linker molecules resulting in distinct downstream signaling effects. Y572/574 are docking sites for STATs and Src family members; Y742 interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and activates PI3K signaling; Y720 and Y754 recruit SHP-2 and thereby activate the MAPK signaling cascade; Y1018 associates with PLC-gamma. We thus speculated that the differential phosphorylation pattern of Y288C protein might lead to differential activation of downstream signaling in distinct subcellular compartments. To test this hypothesis, we treated the MCF10A cells expressing PDGFRA WT or Y288C with monensin, which inhibits protein release from Golgi by blocking medial- to trans-Golgi transition, and brefeldin A (BFA), which impedes protein export from the ER. Membrane localization of PDGFRA WT was decreased and both PDGFRA WT and Y288C protein accumulated in Golgi after monensin treatment (Fig. 4b, upper panel). Further, BFA treatment of PDGFRA WT recapitulated the perinuclear location of Y288C protein in untreated cells and increased the colocalization of both PDGFRA WT and Y288C with calnexin (Fig. 4b, lower panel). These results are consistent with the expected effects of monensin and BFA. Phosphorylation of Y288C protein and activation of downstream signaling pathways after monensin and BFA treatments were evaluated by western blotting (Fig. 4c). Monensin caused a band shift and significantly increased phosphorylation of Y288C protein at Y572/574 and its downstream effectors STAT3/5. These effects were completely abolished by BFA, suggesting that enhanced Y288C phosphorylation at Y572/574 in the Golgi, but not in ER activated STAT signaling. Our finding was in line with a previous study which showed that Golgi localized V561D and D842V led to activation of STAT signaling. Y742 phosphorylation demonstrated similar changes to Y572/574 after treatment with monensin or BFA; however, Akt phosphorylation was decreased by monensin and totally eliminated by BFA. This is consistent with Y288C phosphorylation at Y742 on the cell surface or in the Golgi, but not in ER, being able to activate Akt signaling. Monensin and early time points after BFA treatment did not alter size or amount of p-PDGFRA Y720 and Y754. This is consistent with phosphorylation of Y288C at Y720 and Y754 occurring mainly on the high mannose glycosylated receptor in the ER. Inhibition of cell surface PDGFRA localization by monensin or BFA both markedly decreased but did not abolish ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating ERK1/2 could be activated by cell surface PDGFRA as well as by PDGFR in the Golgi or ER (Fig. 4c). Our results revealed the differential phosphorylation of Y288C protein and subsequent activation of a complex signaling network in distinct subcellular compartment which was absent in PDGFRA WT expressing cells.",

In this study, we present evidence suggesting a direct interaction between the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and the platelet-derived growth factor beta (PDGFbeta) receptor (PDGFbetaR), members of different receptor tyrosine kinase subfamilies. We find that the addition of EGF to COS-7 cells and to human foreskin Hs27 fibroblasts results in a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFbetaR and results in the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the PDGFbetaR. In R1hER cells, which overexpress the EGFR, we find ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFbetaR and the constitutive binding of a substantial amount of PI-3 kinase activity to it, mimicking the effect of ligand in untransfected cells. In support of the possibility that this may be a direct interaction, we show that the two receptors can be coimmunoprecipitated from untransfected Hs27 fibroblasts and from COS-7 cells. This association can be reconstituted by introducing the two receptors into 293 EBNA cells. The EGFR/PDGFbetaR association is ligand-independent in all cell lines tested. We also demonstrate that the fraction of PDGFbetaR bound to the EGFR in R1hER cells undergoes an EGF-induced mobility shift on Western blots indicative of phosphorylation. Our findings indicate that direct interactions between receptor tyrosine kinases classified under different subfamilies may be more widespread than previously believed.",

    "text": "Negative role of RIG-I serine 8 phosphorylation in the regulation of interferon-beta production. \nRIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and TRIM25 (tripartite motif protein 25) have emerged as key regulatory factors to induce interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immune responses to limit viral replication. Upon recognition of viral RNA, TRIM25 E3 ligase binds the first caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of RIG-I and subsequently induces lysine 172 ubiquitination of the second CARD of RIG-I, which is essential for the interaction with downstream MAVS/IPS-1/CARDIF/VISA and, thereby, IFN-beta mRNA production. Although ubiquitination has emerged as a major factor involved in RIG-I activation, the potential contribution of other post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, to the regulation of RIG-I activity has not been addressed. Here, we report the identification of serine 8 phosphorylation at the first CARD of RIG-I as a negative regulatory mechanism of RIG-I-mediated IFN-beta production. Immunoblot analysis with a phosphospecific antibody showed that RIG-I serine 8 phosphorylation steady-state levels were decreased upon stimulation of cells with IFN-beta or virus infection. Substitution of serine 8 in the CARD RIG-I functional domain with phosphomimetic aspartate or glutamate results in decreased TRIM25 binding, RIG-I ubiquitination, MAVS binding, and downstream signaling. Finally, sequence comparison reveals that only primate species carry serine 8, whereas other animal species carry an asparagine, indicating that serine 8 phosphorylation may represent a primate-specific regulation of RIG-I activation. Collectively, these data suggest that the phosphorylation of RIG-I serine 8 operates as a negative switch of RIG-I activation by suppressing TRIM25 interaction, further underscoring the importance of RIG-I and TRIM25 connection in type I IFN signal transduction.",

Here, we report that Shank proteins also bind to Homer. Homer proteins form multivalent complexes that bind proline-rich motifs in group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors and inositol trisphosphate receptors, thereby coupling these receptors in a signaling complex. A single Homer-binding site is identified in Shank, and Shank and Homer coimmunoprecipitate from brain and colocalize at postsynaptic densities. Moreover, Shank clusters mGluR5 in heterologous cells in the presence of Homer and mediates the coclustering of Homer with PSD-95/GKAP. Thus, Shank may cross-link Homer and PSD-95 complexes in the PSD and play a role in the signaling mechanisms of both mGluRs and NMDA receptors.",

At normoxia, HIF-1 alpha is targeted by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In the present study we have observed distinct cell-type-specific differences in the ability of various tested pVHL-interacting subfragments to stabilize HIF-1 alpha and unmask its function at normoxia. These properties correlated with differences in subcellular compartmentalization and degradation of HIF-1 alpha. We observed that the absence or presence of nuclear localization or export signals differently affected the ability of a minimal HIF-1 alpha peptide spanning residues 559 to 573 of mouse HIF-1 alpha to stabilize endogenous HIFalpha and induce HIF-driven reporter gene activity in two different cell types (primary mouse endothelial and HepG2 hepatoma cells). Degradation of HIF-1 alpha occurred mainly in the cytoplasm of HepG2 cells, whereas it occurs with equal efficiency in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of primary endothelial cells. Consistent with these observations, green fluorescent protein-HIF-1 alpha is differently distributed during hypoxia and reoxygenation in hepatoma and endothelial cells. Consequently, we propose that differential compartmentalization of degradation of HIF-1 alpha and the subcellular distribution of HIF-1 alpha may account for cell-type-specific differences in stabilizing HIF-1 alpha protein levels under hypoxic conditions.",

To identify new ligands of the cytoplasmic tail of ErbB-4, we panned a brain cDNA phage library with ErbB-4 peptides containing sequence motifs corresponding to putative docking sites for class-I WW domains. This approach led to identification of AIP4/Itch, a member of the Nedd4-like family of E3 ubiquitin protein ligases, as a protein that specifically interacts with and ubiquitinates ErbB-4 in vivo. Interaction with the ErbB-4 receptors occurs via the WW domains of AIP4/Itch. Functional analyses demonstrate that AIP4/Itch is recruited to the ErbB-4 receptor to promote its polyubiquitination and degradation, thereby regulating stability of the receptor and access of receptor intracellular domains to the nuclear compartment. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the integrity of the ErbB signaling network and mechanistically link the cellular ubiquitination pathway of AIP4/Itch to the ErbB-4 receptor.",

VHL patients are predisposed to develop various vascular tumors, including hemangioblastomas of the retinas and central nervous system, clear cell RCC, pancreatic cysts and adenocarcinomas, and adrenal pheochromocytomas. The VHL gene is also inactivated in the majority of patients with sporadic clear cell RCC. The VHL gene encodes proteins (pVHL) of 25 and 19 kDa through use of alternative translation initiation codons, and both isoforms appear to possess tumor suppressor activity. pVHL has alpha and beta structural domains that are critical to its function as the substrate recognition component of a cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL). The N-terminal beta domain is associated with target protein recognition, while the alpha domain contains a SOCS box that interacts with elongin C and links pVHL to the ubiquitin-ligase complex containing elongin B and C and Cul2. Perhaps the best characterized pVHL CRL targets are the alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Hydroxylation of conserved prolines on HIFalpha subunits under normoxic (21% O2) conditions provides a substrate recognition motif for pVHL polyubiquitylation, and proteasomal degradation. In hypoxia (1% O2) prolyl hydroxylase activity is inhibited, unmodified HIFalpha subunits are stabilized, and the hypoxia response is initiated. We recently demonstrated that pVHL levels are suppressed in hypoxia, providing an additional mechanism for HIFalpha upregulation in hypoxia.",

Because the amount of phosphate released is directly proportional to the sugar molecule transferred in a glycosyltransferase reaction, this method can be used to obtain accurate kinetic parameters of the glycosyltransferase. The assay can be performed in multiwell plates and quantitated by a plate reader, thus making it amenable to high-throughput screening.

An imbalance of H3K27 methylation owing to overexpression of the methylase EZH2 has been implicated in metastatic prostate and aggressive breast cancers.

UTX is enriched around the transcription start sites of many HOX genes in primary human fibroblasts, in which HOX genes are differentially expressed, but is selectively excluded from the HOX loci in ESCs, in which HOX genes are largely silent. Consistently, RNA interference inhibition of UTX led to increased H3K27me3 levels at some HOX gene promoters. Importantly, morpholino oligonucleotide inhibition of a zebrafish UTX homologue resulted in mis-regulation of hox genes and a striking posterior developmental defect, which was partially rescued by wild-type, but not by catalytically inactive, human UTX. Taken together, these findings identify a small family of H3K27 demethylases with important, evolutionarily conserved roles in H3K27 methylation regulation and in animal anterior-posterior development.",

Purification and characterization of translational initiation factor 2.  \nBovine liver mitochondrial translational initiation factor 2 (IF-2mt) has been purified to near homogeneity. The scheme developed results in a 24,000-fold purification of the factor with about 26% recovery of activity. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that IF-2mt has a subunit molecular mass of 85 kDa. IF-2mt promotes the binding of formyl(f)Met-tRNA to mitochondrial ribosomes but is inactive with the nonformylated derivative. IF-2mt is active on chloroplast 30 S ribosomal subunits, but IF-2chl has no activity in promoting fMet-tRNA binding to animal mitochondrial ribosomes. IF-2mt is sensitive to elevated temperatures and is inactivated by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide. It is partially protected from heat and N-ethylmaleimide inactivation by the presence of either GTP or GDP suggesting that guanine nucleotides may bind to this factor directly. The binding of fMet-tRNA to mitochondrial ribosomes requires the presence of GTP and is inhibited by GDP. DeoxyGTP is very effective in replacing GTP in promoting fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes and some activity is also observed with ITP. No activity is observed with ATP, CTP, or UTP. Nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP can promote formation of both 28 S and 55 S initiation complexes indicating that GTP hydrolysis is not required for subunit joining in the animal mitochondrial system.",

Nevertheless, fundamental questions remain unanswered regarding extracellular regulation of the ligand itself, as well as the nature of the downstream transcriptional response to BMP pathway activation. Here, we report the identification of larval translucida (ltl), a novel target of BMP activity in Drosophila. Both gain- and loss-of-function analyses implicate LTL, a leucine-rich repeat protein, in the regulation of wing growth and vein patterning. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that LTL is a secreted protein that antagonizes BMP-dependent MAD phosphorylation, indicating that it regulates DPP/BMP signaling at or above the level of ligand-receptor interactions. Furthermore, based on genetic interactions with the DPP-binding protein Crossveinless 2 and biochemical interactions with the glypican Dally-like, we propose that LTL acts in the extracellular space where it completes a novel auto-regulatory loop that modulates BMP activity.",

The alternative splicing causes a frameshift, resulting in the translation of a truncated protein that lacks the homeodomain. Differentially spliced transcripts resulting in Hox proteins that lack homeodomains have also been described for human HOXA1, murine Hoxb6, human HOXB6, and Xenopus XlHbox2. The functions of these truncated Hox proteins that lack homeodomains have not been studied in depth. However, the truncated HOXB6 protein is expressed in undifferentiated keratinocytes and the full-length protein is induced by differentiation. Moreover, full-length HOXB6 is localized to the nucleus, while the truncated HOXB6 protein is cytoplasmic. The same protein localization patterns have been described for HoxA9. Additionally, the Drosophila melanogaster homothorax (hth) gene also encodes two protein isoforms, one that contains the homeodomain and another truncated protein that does not. These two proteins carry out distinct functions during development. Both proteins are capable of forming functional hth/Exd complexes (vertebrate ortholog of Meis1/Pbx complex), but with putative distinct transcriptional properties. These data indicate that truncated Hox proteins that lack homeodomains may function in regulating differentiation.

In this study, we sought to determine the role of Hoxa1-399 in the differentiation of F9 stem cells induced by RA.",

BRCA1 participates in the DNA damage response and acts as a ubiquitin ligase. However, its regulation remains poorly understood. Here we report that BRCA1 is modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) in response to genotoxic stress, and co-localizes at sites of DNA damage with SUMO1, SUMO2/3 and the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. PIAS SUMO E3 ligases co-localize with and modulate SUMO modification of BRCA1, and are required for BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity in cells. In vitro SUMO modification of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer greatly increases its ligase activity, identifying it as a SUMO-regulated ubiquitin ligase (SRUbL). Further, PIAS SUMO ligases are required for complete accumulation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) damage-repair proteins subsequent to RNF8 accrual, and for proficient double-strand break repair.

    "text": "A novel role for Gab1 and SHP2 in epidermal growth factor-induced Ras activation.  SHP2 was recently found to down-regulate PI3K activation by dephosphorylating Gab1 but the mechanisms explaining the positive role of the Gab1/SHP2 pathway in EGF-induced Ras activation remain ill defined. Substrate trapping experiments now suggest that SHP2 dephosphorylates other Gab1 phosphotyrosines located within a central region displaying four YXXP motifs. Because these sites are potential docking motifs for Ras-GAP, we tested whether SHP2 dephosphorylates them to facilitate Ras activation. We observed that a Gab1 construct preventing SHP2 recruitment promoted membrane relocation of RasGAP. Moreover, a RasGAP-inactive mutant restored the activation of Ras in cells transfected with SHP2-inactivating Gab1 mutant or in SHP2-deficient fibroblasts, supporting the hypothesis that RasGAP is a downstream target of SHP2. To determine whether Gab1 is a RasGAP-binding partner, a Gab1 mutant deleted of four YXXP motifs was produced. The deletion suppressed RasGAP redistribution and restored the defective Ras activation caused by SHP2-inactivating mutations. Moreover, Gab1 was found to interact with RasGAP SH2 domains, only under conditions where SHP2 is not activated. To identify Ras-GAP-binding sites, Tyr to Phe mutants of Gab1 YXXP motifs were produced. Gab1 constructs mutated on Tyr(317) were severely affected in RasGAP binding and were the most active in compensating for Ras-defective activation and blocking RasGAP redistribution induced by SHP2 inactivation. We have thus localized on Gab1 a Ras-negative regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation site involved in RasGAP binding and showed that an important SHP2 function is to down-regulate its phosphorylation to disengage RasGAP and sustain Ras activation.",

IL-22 has a pathogenetic role in psoriasis, where it is responsible for the altered proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes and induces inflammatory molecules. The IL-22-induced effects are mediated by STAT3, whose activity is proportional to acetylation in lysine (Lys)685 and phosphorylation in tyrosine (Tyr)705. Lys 685 acetylation of STAT3 is inhibited by sirtuin (SIRT)1, a class III deacetylase promoting keratinocyte differentiation. Due to the opposite effects of IL-22 and SIRT1, we investigated whether IL-22-induced effects in keratinocytes could be regulated by SIRT1 through control of STAT3. We found that SIRT1 opposes the IL-22-induced STAT3 activity by deacetylating STAT3 and reducing STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation. By controlling STAT3, SIRT1 also influences the IL-22-induced expression of molecules involved in proliferation and inflammation as well as proliferation and migration processes in cultured keratinocytes. Although SIRT1 levels were similar in keratinocytes of healthy individuals and patients with psoriasis, they were reduced in psoriatic skin lesions, with the lymphokine IFN-gamma inhibiting SIRT1 expression. Concomitantly, IFN-gamma enhanced basal acetylation of STAT3 and its phosphorylation induced by IL-22. In conclusion, STAT3-dependent IL-22 signaling and effects in keratinocytes are negatively regulated by SIRT1. In skin affected by psoriasis, SIRT1 is down-regulated by IFN-gamma, which thus renders psoriatic keratinocytes more prone to respond to IL-22.",

We compared effects of the S118A mutation on 17beta-estradiol (E(2))-mediated transactivation, which is heavily dependent on activation function (AF) 2 of ERalpha and on 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT)-mediated transactivation, which is heavily dependent on AF1, which includes S118. To examine whether S118 was the key ERK/MAPK phosphorylation site in ERalpha action, we compared the effects of the S118A mutant and the ERK inhibitor U0126 on expression of endogenous genes. In several estrogen response element-containing genes, the S118A mutation strongly reduced induction by E(2), and U0126 did not further reduce expression. Expression of another group of estrogen response element-containing genes was largely unaffected by the S118A mutation. The S118A mutation had variable effects on genes induced by ER tethering or binding near specificity protein-1 and activator protein-1 sites. For five mRNAs whose expression is strongly down-regulated by E(2) and partially or completely down-regulated by OHT, the S118A mutation reduced or abolished down-regulation by E(2) and nearly abolished down-regulation by OHT. In contrast, for Sma and mothers against decapentaplegic-3-related, which is down-regulated by E(2) and not OHT, the S118A mutation had little effect. These data suggest that there may be distinct groups of genes down-regulated by ERalpha and suggest a novel role for ERK phosphorylation at serine 118 in AF1 in regulating expression of the set of genes down-regulated by OHT.",

Smurf2 is nuclear, but binding to Smad7 induces export and recruitment to the activated TGF beta receptor, where it causes degradation of receptors and Smad7 via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. IFN gamma, which stimulates expression of Smad7, induces Smad7-Smurf2 complex formation and increases TGF beta receptor turnover, which is stabilized by blocking Smad7 or Smurf2 expression.

ILF3 formed a complex with LRH-1 and the other two nuclear receptor co-activators PRMT1 (protein arginine methyltransferase 1) and PGC-1alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1alpha). We demonstrated that ILF3, PRMT1 and PGC-1alpha were recruited to the promoter region of the LRH-1-regulated SHP (small heterodimer partner) gene, encoding one of the nuclear receptors. ILF3 enhanced SHP gene expression in co-operation with PRMT1 and PGC-1alpha through the C-terminal region of ILF3. In addition, we found that the small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of ILF3 expression led to a reduction in the occupancy of PGC-1alpha at the SHP promoter and SHP expression. Taken together, our results suggest that ILF3 functions as a novel LRH-1 co-activator by acting synergistically with PRMT1 and PGC-1alpha, thereby promoting LRH-1-dependent gene expression.",

    "text": "There is currently no literature suggesting a role of beta-Syn in relation to metal homeostasis. However, beta-Syn has been suggested to bind copper. A recent study has shown that it has similar affinity for copper as alpha-Syn and that the co-ordination of copper binding is similar. alpha-Syn not only binds copper but copper binding increases its aggregation and results in the formation of toxic oligomeric species that kill cells both exogenously and endogenously. As beta-Syn has been shown to decrease the aggregation of alpha-Syn, it is conceivable that this process might involve prevention of copper binding to alpha-Syn by either binding copper itself or a physical interaction with alpha-Syn that inhibits copper binding. Alternatively, beta-Syn might out-compete alpha-Syn for copper due to increased expression. In this study we showed that copper appears necessary for beta-syn promoter function, as well MTF-1 induction of the beta-Syn promoter. Indeed, MTF-1 has been shown to act as a copper-sensing transcriptional activator to regulate human prion gene expression, a protein also relevant to neurodegeneration. Increased expression/activity of MTF-1 in response to altered copper levels in the cell could conceivably result in increased levels of beta-Syn, protecting the cell from adverse copper binding by alpha-Syn that could lead to the formation of toxic copper binding oligomers.",

We report the first biochemical characterization of purified human RDH12 and analysis of its expression in human tissues. RDH12 exhibits approximately 2000-fold lower K(m) values for NADP(+) and NADPH than for NAD(+) and NADH and recognizes both retinoids and lipid peroxidation products (C(9) aldehydes) as substrates. The k(cat) values of RDH12 for retinaldehydes and C(9) aldehydes are similar, but the K(m) values are, in general, lower for retinoids. The enzyme exhibits the highest catalytic efficiency for all-trans-retinal (k(cat)/K(m) approximately 900 min(-)(1) microM(-)(1)), followed by 11-cis-retinal (450 min(-)(1) mM(-)(1)) and 9-cis-retinal (100 min(-)(1) mM(-)(1)). Analysis of RDH12 activity toward retinoids in the presence of cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) type I or cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) suggests that RDH12 utilizes the unbound forms of all-trans- and 11-cis-retinoids. As a result, the widely expressed CRBPI, which binds all-trans-retinol with much higher affinity than all-trans-retinaldehyde, restricts the oxidation of all-trans-retinol by RDH12, but has little effect on the reduction of all-trans-retinaldehyde, and CRALBP inhibits the reduction of 11-cis-retinal stronger than the oxidation of 11-cis-retinol, in accord with its higher affinity for 11-cis-retinal. Together, the tissue distribution of RDH12 and its catalytic properties suggest that, in most tissues, RDH12 primarily contributes to the reduction of all-trans-retinaldehyde; however, at saturating concentrations of peroxidic aldehydes in the cells undergoing oxidative stress, for example, photoreceptors, RDH12 might also play a role in detoxification of lipid peroxidation products.",

Kowalski, J. Potz, L. Basiripour, T. Dorfman, W. C. Goh, E. Terwilliger, A. Dayton, C. Rosen, W. A. Haseltine, and J. Sodroski, Science 237:1351-1355, 1987). To localize the determinants on the gp120 envelope glycoprotein important for subunit association, amino acids conserved among primate immunodeficiency viruses were changed. Substitution mutations affecting either of two highly conserved regions located at the amino (residues 36 to 45) and carboxyl (residues 491 to 501) ends of the mature gp120 molecule resulted in nearly complete dissociation of the envelope glycoprotein subunits. Partial dissociation phenotypes were observed for some changes affecting residues in the third and fourth conserved gp120 regions. These results suggest that hydrophobic regions at both ends of the gp120 glycoprotein contribute to noncovalent association with the gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein.",

    "text": "Ubiquitination of alpha-synuclein by Siah-1 promotes alpha-synuclein aggregation and apoptotic cell death.  Point mutations and gene multiplication of alpha-synuclein cause autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, alpha-synuclein- and ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies are the pathological hallmarks of PD and several other neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. Despite the presence of ubiquitinated alpha-synuclein species in Lewy bodies, the regulation of alpha-synuclein ubiquitination and its role in Lewy body formation and neurodegeneration remain poorly understood. Here, we report that alpha-synuclein interacts and colocalizes with mammalian seven in absentia homologue-1 (Siah-1), a RING-type E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Siah-1 binds the brain-enriched E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH8 and facilitates mono- and di-ubiquitination of alpha-synuclein in vivo. The ubiquitination of alpha-synuclein by Siah-1 is disrupted by the PD-linked A30P mutation but not by A53T mutation. We find that Siah-1-mediated ubiquitination does not target alpha-synuclein for degradation by the proteasome, but rather, it promotes alpha-synuclein aggregation and enhances alpha-synuclein toxicity. Our findings suggest that Siah-1-mediated alpha-synuclein ubiquitination may play a critical role in Lewy body formation and PD pathogenesis.",

    "text": "In contrast to other cyclins involved in cell cycle progression, CycC does not oscillate. Instead, Cdk8/CycC activity appears to be regulated by other Mediator subunits. In line with a model previously suggested by others and us, we believe that Med12 and Med13 keep the Cdk8/CycC pair in a repressed state, which can be released when activators and/or signaling pathways induce structural changes in the Mediator complex. Loss of Med12 and/or Med13 may abolish this repressive effect, which explains the early entry into mitosis observed in med12Delta and med13Delta cells. In fact, loss of Med12 and Med13 leads to the release of CycC and Cdk8 from Mediator. We reasoned that a free pool of CycC and Cdk8 might affect cell cycle progression by interacting with alternative cyclins and Cdks. In support of this idea, a previous study of human CycC showed that the protein can interact with an alternative Cdk, namely CDK3. To address this possibility experimentally, here we fused CycC to Cdk8, thereby restricting interaction to the cognate partner and analyzed the effects of med12+ and med13+ deletion on cell cycle progression. As demonstrated here, the effects of med12Deltamed13Delta on mitotic progression are identical in the Cdk8-L-CycC strain to the effects observed in wt cells, strongly suggesting that Cdk8 and CycC act in concert to regulate timing of mitosis. Loss of Med12 and Med13 also causes early entry into S phase. Of interest, this effect is not observed in CycC-L-Cdk8 cells. The data suggest that eliminating the possibility for Cdk8 and CycC to interact with alternative cyclins and Cdks can restrict the effects of med12+ and med13+ deletions on cell cycle progression. Both overproduction of Cdk8 and mutations in CycC are observed in human tumors. It is tempting to speculate that these mutagenic changes may cause the formation of a free Cdk8 pool in mammalian cells, which could result in spontaneous interactions with alternative cyclins and promote S-phase progression. Limited information is available on the role of Cdk8 and CycC in M-phase progression in mammalian cells. We hope that our findings will stimulate others to elucidate whether the effects we observe in fission yeast are also conserved in higher organisms.",

Post-translational modification regulates both the range and efficacy of Hh protein. One such modification is the acylation of the N-terminal cysteine of Hh. In a screen for zygotic lethal mutations associated with maternal effects, we have identified rasp, a novel Drosophila segment polarity gene. Analysis of the rasp mutant phenotype, in both the embryo and wing imaginal disc demonstrates that rasp does not disrupt Wnt/Wingless signaling but is specifically required for Hh signaling. The requirement of rasp is restricted only to those cells that produce Hh; hh transcription, protein levels and distribution are not affected by the loss of rasp. Molecular analysis reveals that rasp encodes a multipass transmembrane protein that has homology to a family of membrane bound O-acyl transferases. Our results suggest that Rasp-dependent acylation is necessary to generate a fully active Hh protein.",

In sol-1 mutants, the remaining components of the GLR-1 complex are also delivered to the postsynaptic membrane, indicating that SOL-1 does not have an essential role in assembly or trafficking of the signaling complex.

We examined here the functional interactions of these GDP/GTP exchange proteins with rho p21 as a substrate. smg GDS and rho GDI interacted with the GDP-bound form of rho p21 and thereby stimulated and inhibited, respectively, the dissociation of GDP. The inhibitory effect of rho GDI was much stronger than the stimulatory effect of smg GDS. The GDP-bound form of rho p21 formed a complex with rho GDI but not with smg GDS in their simultaneous presence. Since the content of smg GDS was generally less than that of rho GDI in cells, these results suggest that there is some mechanism to release the inhibitory action of rho GDI and to make rho p21 sensitive to the smg GDS action during the conversion of rhoA p21 from the GDP-bound inactive form to the GTP-bound active form in intact cells. On the other hand, rho p21 was previously shown to be ADP-ribosylated by bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases, named C3 and EDIN, at Asn41 in the putative effector region of rho p21. This ADP-ribosylation was inhibited by rho GDI much more efficiently than by smg GDS. These results suggest that rho GDI may mask the putative effector region of rho p21 and thereby inhibit its interaction with the target protein even in the presence of smg GDS. Thus, both smg GDS and rho GDI are important to regulate the rho p21 activity and action in cooperation with each other.",

IscS is one of the three Escherichia coli l-cysteine desulfurases. It interacts with FdhD, a protein essential for the activity of formate dehydrogenases (FDHs), which are iron/molybdenum/selenium-containing enzymes. Here, we address the role played by this interaction in the activity of FDH-H (FdhF) in E. coli. The interaction of IscS with FdhD results in a sulfur transfer between IscS and FdhD in the form of persulfides. Substitution of the strictly conserved residue Cys-121 of FdhD impairs both sulfur transfer from IscS to FdhD and FdhF activity. Furthermore, inactive FdhF produced in the absence of FdhD contains both metal centers, albeit the molybdenum cofactor is at a reduced level. Finally, FdhF activity is sulfur-dependent, as it shows reversible sensitivity to cyanide treatment. Conclusively, FdhD is a sulfurtransferase between IscS and FdhF and is thereby essential to yield FDH activity.",

Mammalian rRNA genes are preceded by a terminator element that is recognized by the transcription termination factor TTF-I. In exploring the functional significance of the promoter-proximal terminator, we found that TTF-I associates with the p300/CBP-associated factor PCAF, suggesting that TTF-I may target histone acetyltransferase to the rDNA promoter. We demonstrate that PCAF acetylates TAF(I)68, the second largest subunit of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP)-containing factor TIF-IB/SL1, and acetylation enhances binding of TAF(I)68 to the rDNA promoter. Moreover, PCAF stimulates RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription in a reconstituted in vitro system. Consistent with acetylation of TIF-IB/SL1 being required for rDNA transcription, the NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase mSir2a deacetylates TAF(I)68 and represses Pol I transcription. The results demonstrate that acetylation of the basal Pol I transcription machinery has functional consequences and suggest that reversible acetylation of TIF-IB/SL1 may be an effective means to regulate rDNA transcription in response to external signals.",

Using immunofluorescence microscopy and immunogold labeling, we demonstrate that a functional HA-tagged version of the phosphatase Cdc14 localizes to the nucleolus. Moreover, Cdc14-HA co-localized with the nucleolar NOP2 and GAR1 proteins. By immunofluorescence, Cdc14-HA was found in the nucleolus during most of the mitotic cell cycle, except during anaphase-telophase when it redistributed along the mitotic spindle. While this work was in progress, the same pattern of Cdc14 localization was described by others (Visintin et al, Nature 398 (1999) 818). Constitutive overexpression of CDC14 was toxic and led to cell cycle arrest of cells, mainly in G1. This correlated with the appearance of abnormal nuclear structures. A genetic search for suppressors of the lethality associated with CDC14 overexpression identified YJL076W. Because overproduction of Yj1076w buffered the toxic effect of Cdc14 overproduction, this suggested that it might be a substrate of Cdc14. This has indeed been found to be the case by others who recently described Yj1076w/Netl as a nucleolar protein that physically associates with Cdc14 (Shou et al, Cell 97 (1999) 233). The present data confirm several recently uncovered aspects of the regulation of Cdc14 localization and activity and suggest that the level of expression of CDC14 influences the structural organization of the nucleolus.",

Aberrant collagenolysis may result in diseases such as arthritis, cancer, atherosclerosis, aneurysm and fibrosis. In vertebrates, it is initiated by collagenases belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. The three-dimensional structure of a prototypic collagenase, MMP-1, indicates that the substrate-binding site of the enzyme is too narrow to accommodate triple-helical collagen. Here we report that collagenases bind and locally unwind the triple-helical structure before hydrolyzing the peptide bonds. Mutation of the catalytically essential residue Glu200 of MMP-1 to Ala resulted in a catalytically inactive enzyme, but in its presence noncollagenolytic proteinases digested collagen into typical 3/4 and 1/4 fragments, indicating that the MMP-1(E200A) mutant unwinds the triple-helical collagen. The study also shows that MMP-1 preferentially interacts with the alpha2(I) chain of type I collagen and cleaves the three alpha chains in succession. Our results throw light on the basic mechanisms that control a wide range of biological and pathological processes associated with tissue remodelling.",

We recently discovered that small molecule inhibitors of DPP8/9, including Val-boroPro L-allo-Ile-isoindoline, induce pro-caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis selectively in monocytes and macrophages. Unlike microbial agents that induce caspase-1 dependent pyroptosis, DPP8/9 inhibitors absolutely require caspase-1 to mediate cell death. Here, we demonstrated the utility of DPP8/9 inhibitors as tools to selectively activate caspase-1 in cells. We first showed that active caspase-1 induces apoptosis in the absence of GSDMD, confirming that GSDMD is indeed the only pyroptosis-inducing substrate of caspase-1 in these cells. Second, we demonstrated that caspase-1 activates both caspases-3 and -7 to mediate this apoptotic cell death. Finally, we also discovered that, during apoptosis, caspases-3 and -7 cleave GSDMD at a distinct site from the inflammatory caspases. Caspase-3/7 cleavage of GSDMD renders the protein inactive and unable to induce pyroptosis, showing that apoptotic cells specifically disable lytic cell death. Overall, our data unequivocally demonstrates a role of caspase-1 in apoptosis and reveals previously unknown bidirectional interplay between apoptotic and pyroptotic pathways in innate immune cells.",

To elucidate the role of IFNAR1 in IFN binding and the establishment of biological activity, specific residues of IFNAR1 were mutated. Residues (62)FSSLKLNVY(70) of the S5-S6 loop of the N-terminal subdomain of IFNAR1 and tryptophan-129 of the second subdomain of IFNAR1 were shown to be crucial for IFN-alpha binding and signaling and establishment of biological activity. Mutagenesis of peptide (278)LRV in the third subdomain shows that these residues are critical for IFN-alpha-induced biological activity but not for ligand binding. These data, together with the sequence homology of IFNAR1 with cytokine receptors of known structure and the recently resolved NMR structure of IFNAR2, led to the establishment of a three-dimensional model of the human IFN-alpha/IFNAR1/IFNAR2 complex. This model predicts that following binding of IFN to IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 the receptor complex assumes a \"closed form\", in which the N-terminal domain of IFNAR1 acts as a lid, resulting in the activation of intracellular kinases. Differences in the primary sequence of individual IFN-alpha subtypes and resulting differences in binding affinity, duration of ligand/receptor association, or both would explain differences in intracellular signal intensities and biological activity observed for individual IFN-alpha subtypes.",

Rb is inactivated by phosphorylation upon growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells, facilitating the transition from G(1) phase to S phase. Although the signaling events after growth factor stimulation have been well characterized, it is not yet clear how these signals contact the cell cycle machinery. We had found previously that growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells lead to the direct binding of Raf-1 kinase to Rb, leading to its inactivation. Here we show that the Rb-Raf-1 interaction occurs prior to the activation of cyclin and/or cyclin-dependent kinases and facilitates normal cell cycle progression. Raf-1-mediated inactivation of Rb is independent of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, as well as cyclin-dependent kinases. Binding of Raf-1 seemed to correlate with the dissociation of the chromatin remodeling protein Brg1 from Rb. Disruption of the Rb-Raf-1 interaction by a nine-amino-acid peptide inhibits Rb phosphorylation, cell proliferation, and vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated capillary tubule formation. Delivery of this peptide by a carrier molecule led to a 79% reduction in tumor volume and a 57% reduction in microvessel formation in nude mice. It appears that Raf-1 links mitogenic signaling to Rb and that disruption of this interaction could aid in controlling proliferative disorders.",

    "text": "TGEV infects epithelial cells from the small intestine but is also able to infect cells from the respiratory tract. In the mid-1980s, an attenuated variant of TGEV, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) was isolated in Belgium. This virus provides an example of altered tissue tropism due to a deletion occurring in the spike gene. Unlike TGEV, PRCoV infects only pulmonary epithelial cells. Both spike proteins bind porcine APN, the receptor binding domain being located between residues 522 and 744 of TGEV S protein. The spike protein of TGEV has a hemagglutinating activity that is absent in PRCoV as this activity is contained in the deleted N-terminal part of the protein. One of the consequences of this lack of activity is the inability of PRCoV to replicate in the gut. The hemagglutinating activity was mapped to the residues 145-155 of TGEV spike protein and it has been shown that a mutation abrogating this activity reduced the enteropathogenicity of the virus. In addition, a study has shown that the sialic acid binding activity of TGEV is responsible for binding of an additional protein designated as mucin-like glycoprotein (MPG) in brush border membranes. It has been suggested that this binding might shield the virus from the action of gut emulsifiers. The role of the NTD and carbohydrate binding in TGEV provides interesting insights into coronavirus enterotropism, a property that generally is attributed to non-enveloped viruses. The role of the NTD in other enteric alphacoronaviruses such as FCoV and canine coronavirus (CCoV) is still unknown.",

At physiological concentrations, low density lipoprotein (LDL) increases the sensitivity of platelets to aggregation- and secretion-inducing agents without acting as an independent activator of platelet functions. LDL sensitizes platelets by inducing a transient activation of p38MAPK, a Ser/Thr kinase that is activated by the simultaneous phosphorylation of Thr180 and Tyr182 and is an upstream regulator of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). A similar transient phosphorylation of p38MAPK is induced by a peptide mimicking amino acids 3359-3369 in apoB100 called the B-site. Here we report that the transient nature of p38MAPK activation is caused by platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1), a receptor with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. PECAM-1 activation by cross-linking induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 and a fall in phosphorylated p38MAPK and cPLA2. Interestingly, LDL and the B-site peptide also induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1, and studies with immunoprecipitates indicate the involvement of c-Src. Inhibition of the Ser/Thr phosphatases PP1/PP2A (okadaic acid) makes the transient p38MAPK activation by LDL and the B-site peptide persistent. Inhibition of Tyr-phosphatases (vanadate) increases Tyr-phosphorylated PECAM-1 and blocks the activation of p38MAPK. Together, these findings suggest that, following a first phase in which LDL, through its B-site, phosphorylates and thereby activates p38MAPK, a second phase is initiated in which LDL activates PECAM-1 and induces dephosphorylation of p38MAPK via activation of the Ser/Thr phosphatases PP1/PP2A.",

Activation of the deacetylase and longevity factor SIRT1 prolonged HSF1 binding to the heat shock promoter Hsp70 by maintaining HSF1 in a deacetylated, DNA-binding competent state. Conversely, down-regulation of SIRT1 accelerated the attenuation of the heat shock response (HSR) and release of HSF1 from its cognate promoter elements. These results provide a mechanistic basis for the requirement of HSF1 in the regulation of life span and establish a role for SIRT1 in protein homeostasis and the HSR.",

DDB1 is part of an E3 ligase complex that includes the cullin proteins Cul4A and Cul4B. We report that Cul4A/DDB1 negatively regulates Chk1 stability in vivo. Chk1 associates with Cul4A/DDB1 during an unperturbed cell division cycle and both Chk1 phosphorylation and replication stress enhanced these interactions. Cul4A/DDB1 regulates Chk1 ubiquitination in vivo and Chk1 is directly ubiquitinated in vitro in a Cul4A/DDB1-dependent manner. Furthermore, Chk1 is stabilized in cells deficient for Cul4A/DDB1. This study shows that Chk1 abundance is regulated by the Cul4A/DDB1 ubiquitin ligase during an unperturbed cell division cycle, in response to replicative stress and on heat shock protein 90 inhibition, and that deregulation of the Chk1/Cul4A/DDB1 pathway perturbs the ionizing radiation-induced G(2) checkpoint.",

Overexpression of PCBP2 abrogated cellular responses to viral infection, whereas knockdown of PCBP2 exerted the opposite effect. PCBP2 was induced after viral infection, and its interaction with MAVS led to proteasomal degradation of MAVS. PCBP2 recruited the HECT domain-containing E3 ligase AIP4 to polyubiquitinate and degrade MAVS. MAVS was degraded after viral infection in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts but remained stable in AIP4-deficient (Itch(-/-)) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, coupled with greatly exaggerated and prolonged antiviral responses.

    "text": "Since necrosis of infected cells promotes bacterial dissemination, the utilization of TNT's NAD+-glycohydrolase activity is highly advantageous for Mtb compared to ADP-ribosylating toxins of other bacterial pathogens that trigger apoptosis. TNT may also enable Mtb to control the timing and mode of cell death in other cell types such as neutrophils and dendritic cells, which Mtb is known to invade. However, the toxicity of TNT is also detrimental to Mtb. To protect itself from from self-poisoning, Mtb produces the immunity factor IFT (Fig. 2). The atomic structure of the TNT-IFT complex presented in this study reveals a fully electrostatic binding interface, which ensures picomolar binding affinity between these two proteins and may enable disassembly of IFT in the phagosome at acidic pH. TNT has similar catalytic activity as the SPN glycohydrolase of group A streptococci and a similar protective mechanism, although TNT and IFT lack identifiable sequence and structural similarities with proteins of known function. Although functionally equivalent, TNT and SPN differ in at least three ways. First, TNT is significantly smaller (~150 versus 450 residues) and represents one of the smallest NAD+-binding domain identified to date. Second, TNT has ~160-fold slower catalytic turnover of NAD+, but similar substrate affinity (Supplementary Table 1), possibly resulting in slower toxicity kinetics in vivo. Finally, the secretion mechanisms of TNT and SPN differ greatly. While a signal peptide is sufficient to secrete SPN across the membrane of S. pyogenes, TNT constitutes the C-terminal domain of the outer membrane protein CpnT which resembles autotranporters of Gram-negative bacteria. In the Pfam database, TNT is annotated as a member of the Domain of Unknown Function 4237, which comprises over 600 homologs encompassing approximately 300 bacterial and fungal species. Thus, our results identify a class of novel toxins present in a large group of microorganisms including many mycobacteria, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia pestis, which are known to induce necrosis of infected host cells. In conclusion, our study revealed the structure and enzymatic activity of TNT as an NAD+ glycohydrolase that affects host cell fate on multiple levels. These findings have broad implications in microbial pathogenesis.",

Although several tiRNAs significantly inhibit translation, 5'-tiRNAAla and 5'-tiRNACys are particularly potent translational repressors (Figure 1B). Northern blotting analysis confirmed that luciferase transcripts are not degraded under these conditions (Figure 1B, NB). A dose response analysis comparing 5'- and 3'-tiRNAAla reveals that 5'-tiRNAAla represses translation at low micromolar concentrations (Figure S1). Since the abundance of tiRNAs in angiogenin- or arsenite-treated cells is ~10 fold less than that of tRNA (intracellular tRNA concentration is estimated to be ~10-200 muM depending on cell type (Dr. Tao Pan, personal communication)), similar inhibitory concentrations of tiRNAs are likely to be found in stressed cells. Our calculations predict that the ratio of tiRNAs to mRNAs in stressed cells is ~8, consistent with their ability to repress translation in vivo (see legend to Figure S1). However, actual ratios of tiRNA, mRNA and translation initiation factors found in stressed cells is not known. 5'-tiRNAAla (but not 3'-tiRNAAla) also significantly inhibits the translation of capped luciferase transcripts (Figure 1C), and addition of cap analogue, which inhibits cap-dependent translation, significantly increases the relative translational repression. Northern blotting analysis confirmed that luciferase transcripts are not degraded under these conditions (Figure 1C, NB). Since translation of uncapped mRNAs, or capped mRNAs in the presence of cap analogue, depends on eIF4G binding to the 5' terminus of mRNA, these results suggest that 5'-tiRNAAla interferes with some functions of eIF4G (e.g., binding to mRNA or/and eIF4E).",

Investigating the expression pattern of 50 EMT-related genes in N4ICD-transduced WM9 using a qPCR array revealed 17 significantly changed genes (Supplementary Table S6), of which 11 showed an expression pattern corresponding to a MET (Fig. 2A). Changes of selected EMT markers, including E-cadherin (CDH1), vimentin (VIM), MMP-2 (MMP2), Snail2 (SNAI2), and Twist1 (TWIST1) were confirmed by immunoblotting and qRT-PCR (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2A). Immunohistochemical analyses of 30 primary human melanomas and 30 cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases revealed a significant positive correlation between Notch4 and E-cadherin expression (Fig. 2C, top; Supplementary Table S7). Interestingly, areas, especially melanoma nests, with high Notch4 staining matched with E-cadherin positivity (Fig. 2C, bottom and Supplementary Fig. S2B), but Notch4 was also found in E-cadherin-negative tissue. Snail2 and Twist1 are downregulated in N4ICD-overexpressing cells and both have been shown to be activated by Notch ICD through its main DNA-bound mediator CSL (RBPJ; refs.). Silencing experiments using sequence-specific siRNA targeting CSL showed that both EMTRs are upregulated following CSL knockdown on the protein and mRNA level (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S3A), suggesting that CSL acts as a transcriptional repressor. Analysis of the promoter regions of Snail2 and Twist1 revealed the presence of potential CSL-binding sites (Supplementary Fig. S3B; as reported by refs.). EMSA and ChIP assays showed binding of CSL to these sequences on Snail2 and Twist1 promoters (Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D). Considering canonical Notch signaling, in which binding of Notch ICD to the DNA-bound transcriptional repressor CSL results in target gene activation, these results indicate that Notch4 induced suppression of Snail2 and Twist1 is mediated in a noncanonical fashion, despite CSL binding to promoters of Snail2 and Twist1.",

Here we use five different Chinese hamster ovary cell glycosylation mutants to identify a key aspect of the mechanism of fringe action. Although the beta 3GlcNAcT activity of manic or lunatic fringe is shown to be necessary for inhibition of Jagged1-induced Notch signaling in a coculture assay, it is not sufficient. Fringe fails to inhibit Notch signaling if the disaccharide generated by fringe action, GlcNAc beta 3Fuc, is not elongated. The trisaccharide, Gal beta 4GlcNAc beta 3Fuc, is the minimal O-fucose glycan to support fringe modulation of Notch signaling. Of six beta 4galactosyltransferases (beta 4GalT) in Chinese hamster ovary cells, only beta 4GalT-1 is required to add Gal to GlcNAc beta 3Fuc, identifying beta 4GalT-1 as a new modulator of Notch signaling.",

The spindle association activity of NuMA was mapped to its COOH-terminal part (residues 1538-2115). A recent study showed that the critical sequences for spindle pole localization are contained within the amino acid residues 1750-1800 of NuMA. However, the mechanism by which NuMA binds to microtubules is not clear. NuMA does not contain a microtubule-binding region of kinesin, Map2, or tau, but has been shown to directly bind to tubulin and organize microtubule formation through the distal portion of its COOH-terminal domain.",

    "text": "Direct binding of PP2A to Sprouty2 and phosphorylation changes are a prerequisite for ERK inhibition downstream of fibroblast growth factor receptor stimulation.  In the context of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, Sprouty2 (Spry2) is the most profound inhibitor of the Ras/ERK pathway as compared with other Spry isoforms. An exclusive, necessary, but cryptic PXXPXR motif in the C terminus of Spry2 is revealed upon stimulation. The activation of Spry2 appears to be linked to sequences in the N-terminal half of the protein and correlated with a bandshifting seen on SDS-PAGE. The band-shifting is likely caused by changes in the phosphorylation status of key Ser and Thr residues following receptor stimulation. Dephosphorylation of at least two conserved Ser residues (Ser-112 and Ser-115) within a conserved Ser/Thr sequence is accomplished upon stimulation by a phosphatase that binds to Spry2 around residues 50-60. We show that human Spry2 co-immunoprecipitates with both the catalytic and the regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A-C and PP2A-A, respectively) in cells upon FGF receptor (FGFR) activation. PP2A-A binds directly to Spry2, but not to Spry2Delta50-60 (Delta50-60), and the activity of PP2A increases with both FGF treatment and FGFR1 overexpression. c-Cbl and PP2A-A compete for binding centered around Tyr-55 on Spry2. We show that there are at least two distinct pools of Spry2, one that binds PP2A and another that binds c-Cbl. c-Cbl binding likely targets Spry2 for ubiquitin-linked destruction, whereas the phosphatase binding and activity are necessary to dephosphorylate specific Ser/Thr residues. The resulting change in tertiary structure enables the Pro-rich motif to be revealed with subsequent binding of Grb2, a necessary step for Spry2 to act as a Ras/ERK pathway inhibitor in FGF signaling.",

    "text": "To test whether Ubl4A helps recruit SGTA to Bag6, we took two approaches. First, we generated a structural model of the human SGTA N-domain in complex with Ubl4A UBL by aligning the SGTA-N and Ubl4A UBL structures with the yeast homologous complex. The model indicates that the side chains of two highly conserved acidic residues in SGTA (Asp27 and Glu30) make contacts with Lys48 and Lys6 in Ubl4A, respectively, two residues showing significant chemical shift perturbation in our NMR study (Fig. 4A). We expressed either wild type SGTA or a SGTA mutant bearing D27R and E30R substitutions in cells. Immunoprecipitation showed that compared to wild type SGTA, the D27R/E30R mutant was completely inactive in binding Ubl4A, but its interaction with Hsc70 was maintained (Fig. 4B). The results suggest that the mutations specifically affect the binding site for Ubl4A. Consistent with the notion that Ubl4A serves a link between SGTA and Bag6, Bag6 was not co-precipitated with the SGTA mutant defective in Ubl4A binding. Next, we reconstituted the Ubl4A dependent interaction of SGTA with Bag6 in vitro using purified SGTA and Bag6 or a Bag6-Ubl4A complex. We purified these proteins from HEK293 cells under a high salt condition (see experimental procedure). Nonetheless, the Bag6 sample contained some endogenous Ubl4A. As expected, when Ubl4A was co-expressed with Bag6, the purified complex contained Bag6 and Ubl4A in stoichiometric ratio (Fig. 4C). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that purified Bag6 only moderately co-precipitated SGTA (Fig. 4D, lane 8). This association is probably mediated by the week affinity between the Bag6 UBL and SGTA N-domain. The small amount of endogenous Ubl4A present in the sample may also contribute to this interaction. Importantly, the interaction of Bag6 with SGTA, but not SGTA D27R/E30R was significantly enhanced when stoichiometric amount of Ubl4A was present (lane 10 vs. lanes 8 and 12). Likewise, ectopically expressed Bag6 did not interact significantly with endogenous SGTA in cells (Fig. 3A, Fig. 4E, lane 4), but co-expression of Ubl4A enhanced the interaction (Fig. 4E, lane 3 vs. 4). We conclude from these experiments that Ubl4A can serve as a matchmaker to enhance SGTA binding to Bag6.",

One step in this process is the cleavage of the CAAX motif by the enzyme Ras-converting enzyme 1 (RCE1). Here we show that the deubiquitinating enzyme USP17 negatively regulates the activity of RCE1. We demonstrate that USP17 expression blocks Ras membrane localization and activation, thereby inhibiting phosphorylation of the downstream kinases MEK and ERK. Furthermore, we show that this effect is caused by the loss of RCE1 catalytic activity as a result of its deubiquitination by USP17. We also show that USP17 and RCE1 co-localize at the endoplasmic reticulum and that USP17 cannot block proliferation or Ras membrane localization in RCE1 null cells. These studies demonstrate that USP17 modulates Ras processing and activation, at least in part, by regulating RCE1 activity.",

    "text": "Through the analysis of Gli2 and Gli3 mutant mice, an unexpectedly complex and differential utilization of GliA and GliR function in various Hh-dependent processes during embryonic development was uncovered. For example, Shh is a mitogen and promotes cell proliferation in many embryonic and adult tissues. In the embryonic epidermis, GliA function is the principal effector of Shh-dependent cell proliferation and overexpression of Gli1 or Gli2 can induce spontaneous skin tumorigenesis; however, loss of Gli3 function has minimal effects on hair follicle development and is unable to restore cell proliferation in Shh-/- skin. In many other tissues, GliA function is not essential for Shh-dependent cell proliferation and Shh appears to function primarily by preventing Gli3/GliR action (see for example). Interestingly, there is evidence that Gli3R can block Wnt signaling by binding beta-catenin and inhibiting its transcriptional activator activity. This mechanism may account for many contexts, such as the vertebrate neural tube, in which Hh and Wnt signaling promote cell proliferation in a cooperative or interdependent manner. However, a genome-wide in silico study has predicted a large number of mammalian enhancers harboring both Gli and Tcf binding sites, suggesting that shared enhancer elements may also represent a common mechanism integrating Hh and Wnt signaling. Thus, depending on the developmental context, Shh signaling regulates cell proliferation through a variety of mechanisms involving GliA activity or GliR inhibition.",

Inactivation of C3-derived anaphylatoxin and of bradykinin was accompanied by release of C-terminal arginine from these peptides. The anaphylatoxin inactivator was shown to hydrolyze the synthetic substrates hippuryl-L-arginine and hippuryl-L-lysine and to be inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) or phenanthroline. These observations indicate that the anaphylatoxin inactivator constitutes a metal-dependent enzyme resembling in specificity pancreatic carboxypeptidase B.",

    "text": "Negative regulation of RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling by TRK-fused gene (TFG) protein. \nRIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I)-mediated antiviral signaling serves as the first line of defense against viral infection. Upon detection of viral RNA, RIG-I undergoes TRIM25 (tripartite motif protein 25)-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination, leading to type I interferon (IFN) production. In this study, we demonstrate that TRK-fused gene (TFG) protein, previously identified as a TRIM25-interacting protein, binds TRIM25 upon virus infection and negatively regulates RIG-I-mediated type-I IFN signaling. RIG-I-mediated IFN production and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling pathways were upregulated by the suppression of TFG expression. Furthermore, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication was significantly inhibited by small inhibitory hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of TFG, supporting the suppressive role of TFG in RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling. Interestingly, suppression of TFG expression increased not only RIG-I-mediated signaling but also MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein)-induced signaling, suggesting that TFG plays a pivotal role in negative regulation of RNA-sensing, RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family signaling pathways.",

Calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphoprotein phosphatase found in several tissues, is highly concentrated in mammalian brain. In an attempt to identify endogenous brain substrates for calcineurin, kinetic analyses of the dephosphorylation of several well-characterized phosphoproteins purified from brain were performed. The proteins studied were: G-substrate, a substrate for cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase; DARPP-32, a substrate for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase; Protein K.-F., a substrate for a cyclic nucleotide- and Ca2+-independent protein kinase; and synapsin I, a substrate for cyclic AMP-dependent (site I) and a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (site II). Calcineurin dephosphorylated each of these proteins in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent manner. Similar Km values were obtained for each substrate: G-substrate, 3.8 microM; DARPP-32, 1.6 microM; Protein K.-F., approximately 3 microM (S0.5); synapsin I (site I), 7.0 microM; synapsin I (site II), 4.4 microM. However, significant differences were obtained for the maximal rates of dephosphorylation. The kcat values were: G-substrate, 0.41 s-1; DARPP-32, 0.20 s-1; Protein K.-F., 0.7 s-1; synapsin I (site I), 0.053 s-1; synapsin I (site II), 0.040 s-1.

Using phosphospecific antibodies, we were able to confirm that the dimer interface mutants were indeed phosphorylated on the C-terminal 14-3-3 binding site, indicating that the lack of dimerization for the R>H mutants was not due to a defect in the phosphorylation of this site (Figure S2A). Moreover, in co-immunoprecipitation assays, we observed no defect in the ability of the R>H-Raf mutants to bind other critical Raf interactors such as Ras, 14-3-3, Hsp90, or Cdc37 (Figure 2D), and by mass spectrometry analysis, the only difference observed for R>H-B-Raf was the lack of C-Raf binding (Figure 2E). These findings together with results from an in vitro binding assay using purified Raf proteins (Figure S1D), indicates that the R>H dimer interface mutation specifically disrupts Raf-Raf contact. Finally, we found that the increased dimerization and activation potential of the E>K mutants was still dependent on the phosphorylation of the Raf C-terminal 14-3-3 binding site, as mutation of this site (denoted as S>A) eliminated heterodimerization and activation by EGF treatment (Figure S2B,C).",

Src homology 2-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase (Shp2) functions as a positive effector in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling immediately proximal to activated receptors. However, neither its physiological substrate(s) nor its mechanism of action in RTK signaling has been defined. In this study, we demonstrate that Sprouty (Spry) is a possible target of Shp2. Spry acts as a conserved inhibitor of RTK signaling, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Spry is indispensable for its inhibitory activity. Shp2 was able to dephosphorylate fibroblast growth factor receptor-induced phosphotyrosines on Spry both in vivo and in vitro. Shp2-mediated dephosphorylation of Spry resulted in dissociation of Spry from Grb2. Furthermore, Shp2 could reverse the inhibitory effect of Spry on FGF-induced neurite outgrowth and MAP kinase activation. These findings suggest that Shp2 acts as a positive regulator in RTK signaling by dephosphorylating and inactivating Spry.",

The adaptor 3BP2 has been shown to positively regulate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In this study we present evidence for a physical interaction between 3BP2 and the CD244 receptor. CD244, a member of the CD150 family, is a cell surface protein expressed on NK, CD8+ T, and myeloid cells. CD244 interacts via its Src homology 2 domain with the X-linked lymphoproliferative disease gene product signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-associated protein (SAP)/SH2 domain protein 1A. 3BP2 interacts with human but not murine CD244. CD244-3BP2 interaction was direct and regulated by phosphorylation, as shown by a three-hybrid analysis in yeast and NK cells. Tyr337 on CD244, part of a consensus motif for SAP/SH2 domain protein 1A binding, was critical for the 3BP2 interaction. Although mutation of Tyr337 to phenylalanine abrogated human 3BP2 binding, we still observed SAP association, indicating that this motif is not essential for SAP recruitment. CD244 ligation induced 3BP2 phosphorylation and Vav-1 recruitment. Overexpression of 3BP2 led to an increase in the magnitude and duration of ERK activation, after CD244 triggering. This enhancement was concomitant with an increase in cytotoxicity due to CD244 ligation. However, no differences in IFN-gamma secretion were found when normal and 3BP2-transfected cells were compared. These results indicate that CD244-3BP2 association regulates cytolytic function but not IFN-gamma release, reinforcing the hypothesis that, in humans, CD244-mediated cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma release involve distinct NK pathways.",

The O-fucose modification is found on epidermal growth factor-like repeats of a number of cell surface and secreted proteins. O-Fucose glycans play important roles in ligand-induced receptor signaling. For example, elongation of O-fucose on Notch by the beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase Fringe modulates the ability of Notch to respond to its ligands. The enzyme that adds O-fucose to epidermal growth factor-like repeats, GDP-fucose protein O-fucosyltransferase (O-FucT-1), was purified previously from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Here we report the isolation of a cDNA that encodes human O-FucT-1. A probe deduced from N-terminal sequence analysis of purified CHO O-FucT-1 was used to screen a human heart cDNA library and expressed sequence tag and genomic data bases. The cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 388 amino acids with a predicted N-terminal transmembrane sequence typical of a type II membrane orientation. Likewise, the mouse homolog obtained from an expressed sequence tag and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends of a mouse liver cDNA library encodes a type II transmembrane protein of 393 amino acids with 90.4% identity to human O-FucT-1. Homologs were also found in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans with 41.2 and 29.4% identity to human O-FucT-1, respectively. The human gene (POFUT1) is on chromosome 20 between PLAGL2 and KIF3B, near the centromere at 20p11. The mouse gene (Pofut1) maps near Plagl2 on a homologous region of mouse chromosome 2. POFUT1 gene transcripts were expressed in all tissues examined, consistent with the widespread localization of the modification. Expression of a soluble form of human O-FucT-1 in insect cells yielded a protein of the predicted molecular weight with O-FucT-1 kinetic and enzymatic properties similar to those of O-FucT-1 purified from CHO cells. The identification of the gene encoding protein O-fucosyltransferase I now makes possible mutational strategies to examine the functions of the unusual O-fucose post-translational modification.",

Phosphorylation of PhLP at one or more of three consecutive serines (Ser-18, Ser-19, and Ser-20) is necessary for Gbetagamma dimer formation and is believed to be mediated by the protein kinase CK2. Moreover, several lines of evidence suggest that the cytosolic chaperonin complex (CCT) may work in concert with PhLP in the Gbetagamma-assembly process. The results reported here delineate a mechanism for Gbetagamma assembly in which a stable ternary complex is formed between PhLP, the nascent Gbeta subunit, and CCT that does not include Ggamma. PhLP phosphorylation permits the release of a PhLP x Gbeta intermediate from CCT, allowing Ggamma to associate with Gbeta in this intermediate complex. Subsequent interaction of Gbetagamma with membranes releases PhLP for another round of assembly.",

We demonstrate that the Jumonji domain-containing 6 protein (JMJD6) is a JmjC-containing iron- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase that demethylates histone H3 at arginine 2 (H3R2) and histone H4 at arginine 3 (H4R3) in both biochemical and cell-based assays.

We found that brown fat in normal human bone marrow contains this protein and used marrow-derived preadipocyte lines and long-term cultures to explore potential roles in hematopoiesis. Recombinant adiponectin blocked fat cell formation in long-term bone marrow cultures and inhibited the differentiation of cloned stromal preadipocytes. Adiponectin also caused elevated expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) by these stromal cells and induced release of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). The COX-2 inhibitor Dup-697 prevented the inhibitory action of adiponectin on preadipocyte differentiation, suggesting involvement of stromal cell-derived prostanoids. Furthermore, adiponectin failed to block fat cell generation when bone marrow cells were derived from B6,129S(Ptgs2tm1Jed) (COX-2(+/-)) mice. These observations show that preadipocytes represent direct targets for adiponectin action, establishing a paracrine negative feedback loop for fat regulation. They also link adiponectin to the COX-2-dependent PGs that are critical in this process.",

US11 initiates dislocation of newly translocated MHC I from the ER to the cytosol for proteasome-mediated degradation. Despite the critical role for ubiquitin in this degradation pathway, the responsible E3 ligase is unknown. In a forward genetic screen for host ERAD components hijacked by US11 in near-haploid KBM7 cells, we identified TMEM129, an uncharacterized polytopic membrane protein. TMEM129 is essential and rate-limiting for US11-mediated MHC-I degradation and acts as a novel ER resident E3 ubiquitin ligase. TMEM129 contains an unusual cysteine-only RING with intrinsic E3 ligase activity and is recruited to US11 via Derlin-1. Together with its E2 conjugase Ube2J2, TMEM129 is responsible for the ubiquitination, dislocation, and subsequent degradation of US11-associated MHC-I. US11 engages two degradation pathways: a Derlin-1/TMEM129-dependent pathway required for MHC-I degradation and a SEL1L/HRD1-dependent pathway required for \"free\" US11 degradation. Our data show that TMEM129 is a novel ERAD E3 ligase and the central component of a novel mammalian ERAD complex.",

For example, liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), and GATA transcription factors have been shown to regulate these genes through the intergenic promoter regions. The LXRalpha, bound to the response elements identified in this study, is very likely to interact with other transcription factors which are bound to the intergenic promoter regions. To test this possibility, we have constructed reporter plasmids which contain the 144-bp intergenic promoter region and LXREs in the ECRs 10 and 20. Moderate synergistic transcriptional activation resulted when combinations of five transcription factors, LXRalpha, RXRalpha, GATA4, HNF4alpha, and LRH-1, were tested with pABCG8-LUC, which contains only the intergenic promoter (Fig. 3B). With pE19,20-6'-ABCG8-LUC, which contains the LXRE of ECR20 in addition to the intergenic promoter, strong synergistic transcriptional activation (up to 21 fold) resulted. On the other hand, with pE10,11-3-ABCG8-LUC, which contains the LXRE of ECR10, no striking synergy was observed. However, when both LXREs were inserted upstream from the intergenic promoter region (p(E19,20-6')-(E10,11-3)-ABCG8-LUC(up to 36 fold) resulted, suggesting that both LXREs may play significant roles in regulating ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes. To find out which transcription factors, in combination with LXR/RXR, play important roles in synergistic transcriptional activation, diverse combinations of transcriptional factors were tested with pE19,20-6'-ABCG8-LUC. All of the three transcription factors GATA4, HNF4alpha, and LRH-1 appear to play significant roles in synergistic transcriptional activation (Fig. 3C).",

We have investigated the functional specificity of different retinoid X receptor (RXR)-retinoic acid (RA) receptor (RAR) isotype pairs for the control of expression of endogenous RA-responsive genes, by using wild-type (WT), RXR alpha(-/-), RAR alpha(-/-), RAR gamma(-/-), RXR alpha(-/-)-RAR alpha(-/-), and RXR alpha(-/-)-RAR gamma(-/-) F9 cells, as well as panRXR and RAR isotype (alpha, beta, and gamma)-selective retinoids. We show that in these cells the control of expression of different sets of RA-responsive genes is preferentially mediated by distinct RXR-RAR isotype combinations. Our data support the conclusion that RXR-RAR heterodimers are the functional units transducing the retinoid signal and indicate in addition that these heterodimers exert both specific and redundant functions on the expression of particular sets of RA-responsive genes. We also show that the presence of a given receptor isotype can hinder the activity of another isotype and therefore that functional redundancy between retinoid receptor isotypes can be artifactually generated by gene knockouts.",

We showed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) inhibitor LY294002 inhibits Epo-induced hydrolysis of endogenous GPI and Epo-induced PLC-gamma2 tyrosine phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Wortmannin, another PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor, also suppressed Epo-induced PLC-gamma2 tyrosine phosphorylation. We also present evidence that PLC-gamma2 translocation to the membrane fraction on Epo stimulation is completely inhibited by LY294002. Upon Epo stimulation, the tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-gamma2 was found to be associated with the tyrosine-phosphorylated Grb2-associated binder (GAB)2, SHC and SHP2 proteins. LY294002 cell preincubation did not affect GAB2, SHC and SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation but inhibited the binding of PLC-gamma2 to GAB2 and SHP2.

Structural-functional studies suggest that the proline-rich motif in the N-terminus of AFAP is critical for c-Src activation, and subsequent SRE/AP-1 transactivation and the actin-binding domain in the AFAP C-terminus is negatively involved in the regulation of AFAP/c-Src mediated SRE/AP-1 transactivation.

Transcriptionally competent regions lack H4 lysine 20 methylation, but the modification coincided with condensed chromosomal regions on polytene chromosomes, including chromocenter and euchromatic arms.

But the trafficking mechanisms that control GLUT4 sequestration have remained elusive. Here we describe a functional screen to identify proteins that modulate GLUT4 distribution, and identify TUG as a putative tether, containing a UBX domain, for GLUT4. In truncated form, TUG acts in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit insulin-stimulated GLUT4 redistribution in Chinese hamster ovary cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Full-length TUG forms a complex specifically with GLUT4; in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, this complex is present in unstimulated cells and is largely disassembled by insulin. Endogenous TUG is localized with the insulin-mobilizable pool of GLUT4 in unstimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and is not mobilized to the plasma membrane by insulin. Distinct regions of TUG are required to bind GLUT4 and to retain GLUT4 intracellularly in transfected, non-adipose cells. Our data suggest that TUG traps endocytosed GLUT4 and tethers it intracellularly, and that insulin mobilizes this pool of retained GLUT4 by releasing this tether.",

Activation of the stress-responsive transcription factor NRF2 is the major line of defense to combat oxidative or electrophilic insults. Under basal conditions, NRF2 is continuously ubiquitylated by the KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and is targeted to the proteasome for degradation (the canonical mechanism). However, the path from the CUL3 complex to ultimate proteasomal degradation was previously unknown. p97 is a ubiquitin-targeted ATP-dependent segregase that extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from membranes, protein complexes, or chromatin and has an essential role in autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). In this study, we show that p97 negatively regulates NRF2 through the canonical pathway by extracting ubiquitylated NRF2 from the KEAP1-CUL3 E3 complex, with the aid of the heterodimeric cofactor UFD1/NPL4 and the UBA-UBX-containing protein UBXN7, for efficient proteasomal degradation. Given the role of NRF2 in chemoresistance and the surging interest in p97 inhibitors to treat cancers, our results indicate that dual p97/NRF2 inhibitors may offer a more potent and long-term avenue of p97-targeted treatment.",

Viral proteins are known to be methylated by host protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) necessary for the viral life cycle, but it remains unknown whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins are methylated. Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG motifs, preferred PRMT target sequences. We confirmed arginine methylation of N protein by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated from cell culture. Type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95 or R177 with lysine inhibited interaction of N protein with the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, a property required for viral packaging. We also defined the N protein interactome in HEK293 cells, which identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates, including the known interacting protein G3BP1 as well as other components of stress granules (SGs), which are part of the host antiviral response. Methylation of R95 regulated the ability of N protein to suppress the formation of SGs, as R95K substitution or MS023 treatment blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the coexpression of methylarginine reader Tudor domain-containing protein 3 quenched N protein-mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, pretreatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Because type I PRMT inhibitors are already undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment, inhibiting arginine methylation to target the later stages of the viral life cycle such as viral genome packaging and assembly of virions may represent an additional therapeutic application of these drugs.",

Yap1p is normally cytoplasmic and inactive, but will activate by nuclear translocation if cells are placed in an oxidative environment. Here we show that Yap1p is a target of the beta-karyopherin-like nuclear exporter, Crm1p. Yap1p is constitutively nuclear in a crm1 mutant, and Crm1p binds to a nuclear export sequence (NES)-like sequence in Yap1p in the presence of RanGTP. Recognition of Yap1p by Crm1p is inhibited by oxidation, and this inhibition requires at least one of the three cysteine residues flanking the NES. These results suggest that Yap1p localization is largely regulated at the level of nuclear export, and that the oxidation state affects the accessibility of the Yap1p NES to Crm1p directly. We also show that a mutation in RanGAP (rna1-1) is synthetically lethal with crm1 mutants. Yap1p export is inhibited in both rna1-1 and prp20 (RanGNRF) mutant strains, but Yap1p rapidly accumulates at the nuclear periphery after shifting rna1-1, but not other mutant cells to the non-permissive temperature. Thus, disassembly of export complexes in response to RanGTP hydrolysis may be required for release of substrate from a terminal binding site at the nuclear pore complex (NPC).",

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) play key roles in switching off tyrosine phosphorylation cascades, such as initiated by cytokine receptors. We have used substrate-trapping mutants of a large set of PTPs to identify members of the PTP family that have substrate specificity for the phosphorylated human GH receptor (GHR) intracellular domain. Among 31 PTPs tested, T cell (TC)-PTP, PTP-beta, PTP1B, stomach cancer-associated PTP 1 (SAP-1), Pyst-2, Meg-2, and PTP-H1 showed specificity for phosphorylated GHR that had been produced by coexpression with a kinase in bacteria. We then used GH-induced, phosphorylated GH receptor, purified from overexpressing mammalian cells, in a Far Western-based approach to test whether these seven PTPs were also capable of recognizing ligand-induced, physiologically phosphorylated GHR. In this assay, only TC-PTP, PTP1B, PTP-H1, and SAP-1 interacted with the mature form of the phosphorylated GHR. In parallel, we show that these PTPs recognize very different subsets of the seven GHR tyrosines that are potentially phosphorylated. Finally, mRNA tissue distribution of these PTPs by RT-PCR analysis and coexpression of the wild-type PTPs to test their ability to dephosphorylate ligand-activated GHR suggest PTP-H1 and PTP1B as potential candidates involved in GHR signaling.",

A human homologue of yeast Cdc14, human Cdc14a (hCdc14a), dephosphorylates hCdh1 and activates APC(Cdh1). In contrast, hCdc14a does not affect the activity of APC(Cdc20). hCdc14a is a major phosphatase for hCdh1 and localizes to centrosomes in HeLa cells.

Proteolysis of p27(Kip1) is triggered by Thr187 phosphorylation, which leads to the binding of the SCF(Skp2) (Skp1-Cul1-Rbx1-Skp2) ubiquitin ligase complex. Unlike other known SCF substrates, p27(Kip1) ubiquitination also requires the accessory protein Cks1. The crystal structure of the Skp1-Skp2-Cks1 complex bound to a p27(Kip1) phosphopeptide shows that Cks1 binds to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and C-terminal tail of Skp2, whereas p27(Kip1) binds to both Cks1 and Skp2. The phosphorylated Thr187 side chain of p27(Kip1) is recognized by a Cks1 phosphate binding site, whereas the side chain of an invariant Glu185 inserts into the interface between Skp2 and Cks1, interacting with both.

We show that cyclin G forms a quaternary complex in vivo and in vitro with enzymatically active phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzymes containing B' subunits. Interestingly, cyclin G also binds in vivo and in vitro to Mdm2 and markedly stimulates the ability of PP2A to dephosphorylate Mdm2 at T216. Consistent with these data, cyclin G null cells have both Mdm2 that is hyperphosphorylated at T216 and markedly higher levels of p53 protein when compared to wild-type cells. Cyclin G expression also results in reduced phosphorylation of human Hdm2 at S166. Thus, our data suggest that cyclin G recruits PP2A in order to modulate the phosphorylation of Mdm2 and thereby to regulate both Mdm2 and p53.",

One of these transcription factors, IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), is targeted for proteosomal degradation following virus infection. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are still unknown. In this study, we show that polyubiquitination of IRF-3 increases in response to Sendai virus infection. Using an E1 temperature-sensitive cell line, we demonstrate that polyubiquitination is required for the observed degradation of IRF-3. Inactivation of NEDD8-activating E1 enzyme also results in stabilization of IRF-3 suggesting the NEDDylation also plays a role in IRF-3 degradation following Sendai virus infection. In agreement with this observation, IRF-3 is recruited to Cullin1 following virus infection and overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of Cullin1 significantly inhibits the degradation of IRF-3 observed in infected cells. We also asked whether the C-terminal cluster of phosphoacceptor sites of IRF-3 could serve as a destabilization signal and we therefore measured the half-life of C-terminal phosphomimetic IRF-3 mutants. Interestingly, we found them to be short-lived in contrast to wild-type IRF-3. In addition, no degradation of IRF-3 was observed in TBK1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. All together, these data demonstrate that virus infection stimulates a host cell signaling pathway that modulates the expression level of IRF-3 through its C-terminal phosphorylation by the IkappaB kinase-related kinases followed by its polyubiquitination, which is mediated in part by a Cullin-based ubiquitin ligase.",

Docking studies confirmed the interactions of 4n with the well-known Trp23 and Phe19 clefts, explaining the reasons for its binding affinity for MDM2. 4n at 50 nM is capable of inducing the accumulation of p53 protein, inducing significant apoptotic cell death without affecting the cell cycle progression.

The transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays a central role in regulating inflammation in response to several external signals. The TGFbeta-associated kinase 1 (TAK1) is an upstream regulator of NF-kappaB signaling. In TGFbeta-stimulated cells, TAK1 undergoes Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys-34 by TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and is thereby activated. The aim of this study was to investigate whether TAK1 polyubiquitination at Lys-34 is also essential for NF-kappaB activation via TNF receptor, IL-1 receptor and toll-like receptor 4. We observed that TAK1 polyubiquitination occurred at Lys-34 and required the E3 ubiquitin ligase TNF receptor-associated factor 6 after stimulation of cells with IL-1beta. Polyubiquitination of TAK1 also occurred at Lys-34 in cells stimulated by TNF-alpha and LPS, which activates TLR4, as well as in HepG2 and prostate cancer cells stimulated with TGFbeta, which in all cases resulted in NF-kappaB activation. Expression of a K34R-mutant TAK1 led to a reduced NF-kappaB activation, IL-6 promoter activity, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion by TNF-alpha-stimulated PC-3U cells. Similar results were obtained in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 after LPS treatment. In conclusion, polyubiquitination of TAK1 is correlated with activation of TAK1 and is essential for activation of NF-kappaB signaling downstream of several receptors.",

In this manuscript, we identified a budding yeast Mcm10 mutant (Mcm10-m2,3,4) that is defective in DNA binding in vitro. Moreover, this Mcm10-m2,3,4 mutant does not stimulate the phosphorylation of Mcm2 by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) in vitro. When we expressed wild-type levels of mcm10-m2,3,4 in budding yeast cells, we observed a severe growth defect and a substantially decreased DNA replication. We also observed a substantially reduced replication protein A- chromatin immunoprecipitation signal at origins of replication, reduced levels of DDK-phosphorylated Mcm2, and diminished Go, Ichi, Ni, and San (GINS) association with Mcm2-7 in vivo. mcm5-bob1 bypasses the growth defect conferred by DDK-phosphodead Mcm2 in budding yeast. However, the growth defect observed by expressing mcm10-m2,3,4 is not bypassed by the mcm5-bob1 mutation. Furthermore, origin melting and GINS association with Mcm2-7 are substantially decreased for cells expressing mcm10-m2,3,4 in the mcm5-bob1 background. Thus, the origin melting and GINS-Mcm2-7 interaction defects we observed for mcm10-m2,3,4 are not explained by decreased Mcm2 phosphorylation by DDK, since the defects persist in an mcm5-bob1 background. These data suggest that DNA binding by Mcm10 is essential for the initiation of DNA replication.",

Here we describe new roles for Bur1-Bur2 and the Paf1 complex. We find that histone H3 K36 tri-methylation requires specific components of the Paf1 complex and that K36 tri-methylation is more strongly affected at the 5' ends of genes in paf1delta and bur2delta strains in parallel with increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Interestingly, the 5' increase in histone acetylation is independent of K36 methylation, and therefore is mechanistically distinct from the methylation-driven deacetylation that occurs at the 3' ends of genes. Finally, Bur1-Bur2 and the Paf1 complex have a second methylation-independent function, since bur2delta set2delta and paf1delta set2delta double mutants display enhanced histone acetylation at the 3' ends of genes and increased cryptic transcription initiation. These findings identify new functions for the Paf1 and Bur1-Bur2 complexes, provide evidence that histone modifications at the 5' and 3' ends of coding regions are regulated by distinct mechanisms, and reveal that the Bur1-Bur2 and Paf1 complexes repress cryptic transcription through a Set2-independent pathway.",

Both coactivators interact with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and activate NRF-1 target genes required for respiratory chain expression. Here, we establish that PRC belongs to the class of immediate early genes that are rapidly induced in the transition from quiescence to proliferative growth. As observed for other members of this class, the rapid serum induction of PRC mRNA does not require de novo protein synthesis and inhibition of protein synthesis stabilizes PRC mRNA, leading to its superinduction. Previous work indicated that PRC activation of cytochrome c expression occurs through cis-acting elements that bind both NRF-1 and CREB. Here, we demonstrate that, like NRF-1, CREB binds PRC in vitro and exists in a complex with PRC in cell extracts. Both CREB and NRF-1 bind the same sites on PRC, and the interaction with CREB requires the CREB b-Zip DNA binding domain. Moreover, a CREB/NRF-1 interaction domain on PRC is required for its trans activation of the cytochrome c promoter and a PRC subfragment containing this domain inhibits respiratory growth on galactose when expressed in trans from a lentivirus vector. Finally, PRC associates with the cytochrome c promoter in vivo and its occupancy of the promoter is markedly elevated in response to serum induction of quiescent fibroblasts. The results establish that PRC is an immediate early gene product that can target key transcription factors as an early event in the program of cellular proliferation.",

As such, a PDE10A-selective inhibitor compound, MP-10, has recently entered clinical testing. Since little is known about the cellular regulation of PDE10A, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms that govern its subcellular localization in striatal medium spiny neurons. Previous reports suggest that PDE10A is primarily membrane bound and is transported throughout medium spiny neuron axons and dendrites. Moreover, it has been shown in PC12 cells that the localization of the major splice form, PDE10A2, may be regulated by protein kinase A phosphorylation at threonine 16 (Thr-16). Using an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Thr-16 (pThr-16) of PDE10A2, we provide evidence that phosphorylation at Thr-16 is critical for the regulation of PDE10A subcellular localization in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate in primary mouse striatal neuron cultures that PDE10A membrane association and transport throughout dendritic processes requires palmitoylation of cysteine 11 (Cys-11) of PDE10A2, likely by the palmitoyl acyltransferases DHHC-7 and -19. Finally, we show that Thr-16 phosphorylation regulates PDE10A trafficking and localization by preventing palmitoylation of Cys-11 rather than by interfering with palmitate-lipid interactions. These data support a model whereby PDE10A trafficking and localization can be regulated in response to local fluctuations in cAMP levels. Given this, we propose that excessive striatal dopamine release, as occurs in schizophrenia, might exert differential effects on the regulation of PDE10A localization in the two striatal output pathways.",

The most prominent components of this enhancer complex are the proteins hnRNP F, KSRP, and an unidentified protein of 58 kDa (p58). This p58 protein was purified from the WERI-1 cell nuclear extract by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Mono Q chromatography, and immunoprecipitation with anti-Sm antibody Y12. Peptide sequence analysis of purified p58 protein identified it as hnRNP H. Immunoprecipitation of hnRNP H cross-linked to the N1 enhancer RNA, as well as gel mobility shift analysis of the enhancer complex in the presence of hnRNP H-specific antibodies, confirmed that hnRNP H is a protein component of the splicing enhancer complex. Immunoprecipitation of splicing intermediates from in vitro splicing reactions with anti-hnRNP H antibody indicated that hnRNP H remains bound to the src pre-mRNA after the assembly of spliceosome. Partial immunodepletion of hnRNP H from the nuclear extract partially inactivated the splicing of the N1 exon in vitro. This inhibition of splicing can be restored by the addition of recombinant hnRNP H, indicating that hnRNP H is an important factor for N1 splicing. Finally, in vitro binding assays demonstrate that hnRNP H can interact with the related protein hnRNP F, suggesting that hnRNPs H and F may exist as a heterodimer in a single enhancer complex. These two proteins presumably cooperate with each other and with other enhancer complex proteins to direct splicing to the N1 exon upstream.",

Time-lapse, FRAP and FRET analyses in human cells showed that barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), a DNA-binding protein, assembled first at the distinct ;core' region of the telophase chromosome and formed an immobile complex by directly binding with other core-localizing NE proteins, such as lamin A and emerin. Correlative light and electron microscopy after live cell imaging, further showed that BAF formed an electron-dense structure on the chromosome surface of the core, close to spindle microtubules (MTs) prior to the attachment of precursor NE membranes, suggesting that MTs may mediate core assembly of BAF. Disruption of the spindle MTs consistently abolished BAF accumulation at the core. In addition, RNAi of BAF eliminated the core assembly of lamin A and emerin, caused abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of precursor nuclear membranes and resulted in a significant delay of NE assembly. These results suggest that the MT-mediated BAF accumulation at the core facilitates NE assembly at the end of mitosis.",

This report identifies two mutants that block uptake by blocking ubiquitination, these being mutant either for the ankyrin repeat protein Akr1p or for the redundant type I casein kinases Yck1p and Yck2p. While no obvious defect was seen for wild-type Ste3p phosphorylation in akr1 or yck mutant backgrounds, examination of the Delta320-413 Ste3p deletion mutant phosphorylation did reveal a clear defect in both mutants. The Delta320-413 deletion removes 18 Ser-Thr residues (possible YCK-independent phosphorylation sites) yet retains the 15 Ser-Thr residues of the Ste3p PEST-like ubiquitination-endocytosis signal. Two other phenotypes link akr1 and yck mutants: both are defective in phosphorylation of wild-type alpha-factor receptor, and while both are defective for Ste3p constitutive internalization, both remain partially competent for the Ste3p ligand-dependent uptake mode. Yck1p-Yck2p may be the function responsible in phosphorylation of the PEST-like ubiquitination-endocytosis signal. Akr1p appears to function in localizing Yck1p-Yck2p to the plasma membrane, a localization that depends on prenylation of C-terminal dicysteinyl motifs. In akr1Delta cells, Yck2p is mislocalized, showing a diffuse cytoplasmic localization identical to that seen for a Yck2p mutant that lacks the C-terminal Cys-Cys, indicating a likely Akr1p requirement for the lipid modification of Yck2p, for prenylation, or possibly for palmitoylation.",

The two proteins share a common structural organization that features an N-terminal RING domain and two C-terminal BRCT motifs, whereas BARD1 alone also contains three tandem ankyrin repeats. In normal cells, the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer is believed to enhance chromosome stability by promoting homology-directed repair (HDR) of double strand DNA breaks. Here we have investigated the structural requirements for BARD1 in this process by complementation of Bard1-null mouse mammary carcinoma cells. Our results demonstrate that the ankyrin and BRCT motifs of BARD1 are each essential for both chromosome stability and HDR. Tandem BRCT motifs, including those found at the C terminus of BARD1, are known to form a phosphoprotein recognition module. Nonetheless, the HDR function of BARD1 was not perturbed by synthetic mutations predicted to ablate the phospho-recognition activity of its BRCT sequences, suggesting that some functions of the BRCT domains are not dependent on their ability to bind phosphorylated ligands. Also, cancer-associated missense mutations in the BRCT domains of BARD1 (e.g. C557S, Q564H, V695L, and S761N) have been observed in patients with breast, ovarian, and endometrial tumors. However, none of these was found to affect the HDR activity of BARD1, suggesting that any increased cancer risk conferred by these mutations is not because of defects in this repair mechanism.",

Here we show that PTEN level is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, and purified its ubiquitin ligase as HECT-domain protein NEDD4-1. In cells NEDD4-1 negatively regulates PTEN stability by catalyzing PTEN polyubiquitination. Consistent with the tumor-suppressive role of PTEN, overexpression of NEDD4-1 potentiated cellular transformation. Strikingly, in a mouse cancer model and multiple human cancer samples where the genetic background of PTEN was normal but its protein levels were low, NEDD4-1 was highly expressed, suggesting that aberrant upregulation of NEDD4-1 can posttranslationally suppress PTEN in cancers. Elimination of NEDD4-1 expression inhibited xenotransplanted tumor growth in a PTEN-dependent manner. Therefore, NEDD4-1 is a potential proto-oncogene that negatively regulates PTEN via ubiquitination, a paradigm analogous to that of Mdm2 and p53.",

Axin is a negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling via regulating the level of beta-catenin, which is a key effector molecule. Therefore, controlling the level of Axin is a critical step for the regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. It has been shown that ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation may play a critical role in the regulation of Axin; however, the E3 ubiquitin ligase(s), which attaches ubiquitin to a target protein in combination with an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, for Axin has not yet been identified. Here, we show that Smurf2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Axin. Transient expression of Smurf2 down-regulated the level of Axin and increased the ubiquitination of Axin. Conversely, shRNA specific to Smurf2 blocked Axin ubiquitination. Essential domains of Axin responsible for Smurf2 interaction as well as Smurf2-mediated down-regulation and ubiquitination were identified. In vitro ubiquitination assays followed by analysis using mass spectroscopy revealed that Smurf2 specifically ubiquitinylated Lys(505) of Axin and that the Axin(K505R) mutant resisted degradation. Knockdown of endogenous Smurf2 increased the level of endogenous Axin and resulted in reduced beta-catenin/Tcf reporter activity. Overall, our data strongly suggest that Smurf2 is a genuine E3 ligase for Axin.",

The principal form of vitamin E found in humans, RRR-alpha-tocopherol (TOH), is thought to protect cells by virtue of its ability to quench free radicals, and functions as the main lipid-soluble antioxidant. Regulation of vitamin E homeostasis occurs in the liver, where TOH is selectively retained while other forms of vitamin E are degraded. Through the action of tocopherol transfer protein (TTP), TOH is then secreted from the liver into circulating lipoproteins that deliver the vitamin to target tissues. Presently, very little is known regarding the intracellular transport of vitamin E. We utilized biochemical, pharmacological, and microscopic approaches to study this process in cultured hepatocytes. We observe that tocopherol-HDL complexes are efficiently internalized through scavenger receptor class B type I. Once internalized, tocopherol arrives within approximately 30 min at intracellular vesicular organelles, where it co-localizes with TTP, and with a marker of the lysosomal compartment (LAMP1), before being transported to the plasma membrane in a TTP-dependent manner. We further show that intracellular processing of tocopherol involves a functional interaction between TTP and an ABC-type transporter.",

(1999) Science 284, 2174-2177]. To further evaluate the significance of H3 methylation, we studied the kinetics and site specificity of its modification by CARM1. Affinity-purified CARM1 methylated recombinant chick H3, which is free of posttranslational modifications, and calf thymus H3, which is heterogeneous with regard to preexisting modifications, equally well, exhibiting a V(max) of 4500 pmol min(-1) (mg of enzyme)(-1) and an apparent K(m) for H3 of < or = 0.2 microM. The catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of CARM1 toward H3 was at least 1000 times that toward R1 (GGFGGRGGFGG-amide), a highly effective substrate for protein arginine methyltransferase 1. Peptide mapping of 3H-methyl-labeled H3 indicated methylation at Arg-2, Arg-17, and Arg-26 in the N-terminal region and at one or more of four arginines (128/129/131/134) at the C-terminus. Two of the N-terminal sites, Arg-17 and Arg-26, occur in the sequence KAXRK and appear to be more efficiently methylated than Arg-2. CARM1 catalyzed formation of N(G),N(G)-dimethylarginine (asymmetric) but little or no N(G),N'(G)-dimethylarginine (symmetric) and no form of methyllysine. Amino acid analysis of untreated calf thymus H3 revealed that 3.7% of the molecules naturally contain asymmetric dimethylarginine and/or monomethylarginine. Our findings support the hypothesis that methylation of H3 may be involved in the mechanism of transcriptional coactivation by CARM1 of genes whose expression is under the control of nuclear receptors.",
