DSBs can be processed into single-stranded DNA that is bound by replication protein A (RPA) to promote ATR signalling and DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR). Notably, RPA accumulation in laser-lines (whether normalized or not to cell cycle profiles in Supplementary Fig. 10e) was impaired by PIAS1 or PIAS4 depletion (Supplementary Figs 8a-c). Furthermore, phosphorylation of the 34 kDa subunit of RPA on Ser-4 and Ser-8 (pS4/pS8) in response to IR or camptothecin treatment was diminished by PIAS4 depletion, while PIAS1 depletion impaired IR-induced but not camptothecin-induced RPA phosphorylation (Fig. 3e; CtIP depletion also impaired RPA phosphorylation, as previously reported). Consistent with these findings and the involvement of BRCA1 and RPA in DNA repair by HR, PIAS1 or PIAS4 depletion reduced HR in a cell-based gene conversion assay (Fig. 3f). PIAS1 and PIAS4 depletion also impaired DSB repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) as assessed by a cell-based plasmid-integration assay (Fig. 3g) and resulted in IR hypersensitivity (Fig. 3h).
