Although we showed that cyclin E/A-CDK activity levels in G1 are typically insufficient to hyperphosphorylate Rb in the presence of CDK4/6 inhibitors, it remained unclear whether a low level of cyclin E/A-CDK is necessary to hyperphosphorylate Rb. We thus inhibited cyclin E/A-CDK with a CDK2 inhibitor and were surprised to observe no inhibition of Rb hyperphosphorylation (Figure 3I), suggesting that cyclin E-CDK2 activity is not required to sustain Rb hyperphosphorylation. To test for a requirement of either E- or A-type cyclins, we used a CreLox system to conditionally abolish all E- and A-type cyclins in mitogen-released mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Control experiments showed that the knockout extinguished cyclin E/A-CDK activity (Figure 3J), yet we still observed CDK4/6-dependent Rb hyperphosphorylation to a similar degree as for the unfloxed condition. Furthermore, the E2F target Cdc6 was still expressed in a CDK4/6-dependent manner in the absence of E- and A-type cyclins (Figure 3K). Similar results were also observed following acute CDK4/6 inhibition under continuous growth conditions (Figure S2K). Taken together, these results are consistent with an interpretation that cyclin E/A-CDK activity is not required to sustain or substantially trigger Rb hyperphosphorylation in G1, while CDK4/6 is required to hyperphosphorylate Rb during this time window.
