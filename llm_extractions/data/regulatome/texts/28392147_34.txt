Caspase-1 plays a central role in the innate immune response to microbial infections by activating inflammatory cytokines and mediating a lytic form of cell death known as pyroptosis. We recently discovered that small molecule inhibitors of DPP8/9, including Val-boroPro L-allo-Ile-isoindoline, induce pro-caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis selectively in monocytes and macrophages. Unlike microbial agents that induce caspase-1 dependent pyroptosis, DPP8/9 inhibitors absolutely require caspase-1 to mediate cell death. Here, we demonstrated the utility of DPP8/9 inhibitors as tools to selectively activate caspase-1 in cells. We first showed that active caspase-1 induces apoptosis in the absence of GSDMD, confirming that GSDMD is indeed the only pyroptosis-inducing substrate of caspase-1 in these cells. Second, we demonstrated that caspase-1 activates both caspases-3 and -7 to mediate this apoptotic cell death. Finally, we also discovered that, during apoptosis, caspases-3 and -7 cleave GSDMD at a distinct site from the inflammatory caspases. Caspase-3/7 cleavage of GSDMD renders the protein inactive and unable to induce pyroptosis, showing that apoptotic cells specifically disable lytic cell death. Overall, our data unequivocally demonstrates a role of caspase-1 in apoptosis and reveals previously unknown bidirectional interplay between apoptotic and pyroptotic pathways in innate immune cells.
