We also performed ChIP assays to investigate histone modifications characteristic of transcriptionally active or inactive chromatin on the RUNX1-dependent GMCSF and IL3 promoters, or the silent hOC promoter in Jurkat cells. ChIP analyses were carried out using two antibodies recognizing active epigenetic marks (i.e., acetylated H4 [H4-Ac] and H3 dimethyl lysine 4 [H3K4me2]), and one antibody recognizing a repressive histone modification (H3 dimethyl lysine 27 [H3K27me2]). We observed that the active GMCSF and IL3 promoters are associated with H3K4me2 and H4-Ac, but not with H3K27me2 (Figure 4). These two genes interact robustly with RNA polymerase II, as well as with RUNX1, BRG1 and INI1. In contrast, the inactive hOC gene promoter is associated predominantly with H3K27me2 and exhibits background binding for RNA polymerase II and the other factors. Taken together, these results demonstrate that BRG1 and INI1 subunits of the human SWI/SNF complex are associated with active RUNX1 target gene promoters in hematopoietic cells.
