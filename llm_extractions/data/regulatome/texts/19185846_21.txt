Because IL-23R signals through Stat3, and Stat3 can affect expression of FoxP3 and IL-10 in CD4+ T cells, we evaluated directly whether IL-23R signaling impacts Treg in the tumor microenvironment and whether this directly enhanced B16 tumor growth in vivo. IL-23R blockade affected tumor infiltrating Tregs in a manner similar but not identical to T cell-specific Stat3 ablation (Fig. 7A, B). Anti-IL-23R treated mice displayed a modest but significant reduction in the number of tumor infiltrating Treg numbers compared with control antibody treated mice. However, FoxP3 levels were diminished (Fig. 7A, right panel), as was IL-10 production (Fig. 7B), after anti-IL-23R treatment. While these results are consistent with a role for IL-23 driven Stat3 activation in tumor-infiltrating Treg although additional IL-23R dependent signaling pathways (such as Stat5) are likely operative in tumor infiltrating Treg. In addition, other cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (such as IL-10) could be additionally contributing to Stat3 activation in tumor infiltrating Treg. The effects of IL-23 within the tumor microenvironment indeed translate to an overall enhancement of tumor growth, as in vivo IL-23R blockade resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth relative to isotype control antibody (Fig. 7C).
