We first sought to identify effectors of Arl6 by affinity chromatography. Mutations were introduced into Arl6 to preclude GTP hydrolysis (Q73L) and to limit aggregation of the GTP-bound form (DeltaN16). We chose retinal extract as a starting material because of the tremendous rates of membrane protein trafficking to cilia in photoreceptors. Remarkably, eight protein bands were recovered specifically in the eluate of the Arl6GTP column and were identified as the eight subunits of the BBSome (Figure 1A). Further, direct "in-solution" mass spectrometry analysis of the eluates failed to identify any Arl6 effector besides the BBSome subunits. TACT1, the only other protein specifically recovered in the Arl6GTP eluate, binds directly to the BBSome and likely binds to Arl6GTP indirectly (Figure 1B; TS and MVN, unpublished). Furthermore, immunoblotting showed that over 75% of the BBSome was depleted by the Arl6GTP column and recovered in the Arl6GTP eluate while no BBSome binding to Arl6GDP and GST was detected (Figure 1C). Thus, the BBSome is the major Arl6 effector in retinal extracts. We further confirmed the BBSome-Arl6GTP interaction by showing that BBS1 was the BBSome subunit most efficiently captured by Arl6GTP and by mapping the interaction domain to the N-terminus of BBS1 (Figure 1D). Since Arl6 is the only BBS gene besides the BBSome subunits to be universally conserved in ciliated organisms, these results tie all of the conserved BBS proteins into two connected biochemical units and suggest a conserved function for the BBSome/ Arl6GTP interaction.
