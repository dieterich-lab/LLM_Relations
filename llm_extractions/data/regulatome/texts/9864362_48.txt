A model for aggresome formation is illustrated in Fig. 8. Integral membrane proteins like CFTR and PS1 that are cotranslationally translocated and glycosylated at the ER (step 1) can either fold (step 1a) or be multiubiquitinated and targeted for rapid degradation by the proteasome (steps 2 and 3). The data in this paper show that aggresome formation results either from overexpression of inefficiently folded proteins like CFTR or DeltaF508 (increasing steps 1 and 2), or from inhibiting proteasomes (preventing steps 3, 7a, and 7b), suggesting that the formation of aggresomes is a cellular stress response pathway for misfolded protein.
