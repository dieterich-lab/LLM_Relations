The second key difference is the organization of the lariat loop. In Delta206-MRPP3, the lariat loop forms an extended hydrogen bond network between the PPR and metallonuclease domain (Figure 1E). In contrast, the PRORP1 lariat loop is four residues shorter and adopts a horseshoe-like bend, in which the internal hydrogen bond network is concentrated within a hook that forms at the tip of the lariat loop (Supplementary Figure S5). Moreover, also in vast contrast to Delta206-MRPP3, there is only a single hydrogen bond with the PPR domain and a salt bridge with R518P, which is located in beta6 of the metallonuclease domain. Furthermore, the lariat loop regions of Delta206-MRPP3 and PRORP1 are oriented at ~90degrees to each other (Supplementary Figure S4B). Interestingly, the lariat loop sequence is strongly conserved in higher vertebrates (Supplementary Figure S2). To test whether removing the lariat loop from MRPP3 would result in MRPP1/2-independent activity, we replaced the MRPP3 lariat loop with a short linker (GSG). However, yet again, the MRPP3 mutant was only active in the presence of MRPP1/2 (Supplementary Figure S5C).
