Autophagy is a cellular process mediating degradation of bulk cytoplasm, long-lived proteins, and entire organelles. In this process, double-membraned vesicles, termed autophagosomes, wrap around portions of cytosol and transport them to the lysosome for degradation. In mammalian cells, mTOR is a nutrient sensor that represses autophagy and regulates protein synthesis. The serine/threonine kinase ULK1 (a yeast ATG1 orthologue involved in mATG9 trafficking) plays an essential role downstream of mTOR on the regulation of autophagy. As described previously, mTOR inhibits ULK1 activity by binding and phosphorylating it. After nutrient deprivation, mTOR dissociates from ULK1, allowing its activation. A few ULK1 targets have been identified so far, such as its interactors FIP200 and ATG13. However, a molecular link between ULK1 activity and autophagosome formation is still missing. Autophagosome formation requires phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and is believed to occur in specific subdomains of the ER, termed omegasomes. Recent data suggest the mitochondria as additional sites of autophagosome formation. BECLIN 1 and VPS34, which form a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) complex, generate PI3P at the omegasome and are crucial for autophagosome nucleation. Recent findings provide strong biochemical evidence that mammalian BECLIN 1 exists in distinct class III PI3K complexes. Like in yeast, each complex seems to have a core consisting of BECLIN 1, VPS34, and VPS15 and specific interactors, such as ATG14/BARKOR, UVRAG, or RUBICON, conferring them distinct functions in membrane trafficking. AMBRA1 has been identified as a crucial factor in regulating autophagy in vertebrates. Its inactivation in vivo gives rise to defects in the developing nervous system and to embryonic death. AMBRA1 promotes BECLIN 1 interaction with its target lipid kinase VPS34, thus mediating autophagosome nucleation.
