BMMs internalize cercarial E/S products and produce IL-10 in a TLR-dependent manner. (A) Representative confocal image (12 x 20 mum) of a BMM exposed to 50 mug/ml 0-3hRPAF633 (red) for 60 min, labeled with anti-EEA-1 Abs (cyan), and counterstained with DAPI (blue). Arrowheads indicate the location of 0-3hRPAF633 within EE-A+ (white) or EEA-1- (yellow) endosomes. Cell membrane is shown in white. Representative overlaid flow cytometry histograms (B) and mean MFI +/- SEM (C) of BMMs exposed to 50 mug/ml 0-3hRPAF633 (closed circles) or media control (open circles). Symbols are means of three technical replicates. Fold changes in transcript RNA (D and E) and protein levels of IL-10 and IL-12p40 (F and G) in cultures of WT BMMs exposed to 50 mug/ml 0-3hRP (closed circles) or corresponding media controls (open circles). Symbols represent mean from four biological replicates. (H and I) IL-10 and IL-12p40 produced by overnight cultures of WT, MyD88-/-, TLR2-/-, or TLR4-/- BMMs exposed to 50 mug/ml 0-3hRP or media. Histogram bars are means for selected groups of WT and transgenic BMMs (four biological replicates). ANOVA and multiple comparisons tests (Bonferroni, Dunnett, and Sidak) were performed to examine statistically significant differences (C-G) between 0-3hRP-treated BMMs and corresponding media control at each time point or (H and I) between treated BMMs from different strains of mice. Dotted lines represent no fold changes in RNA levels (D and E) or lower detection limit of ELISA tests (F-I). Results are representative of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. ns, p > 0.05.
