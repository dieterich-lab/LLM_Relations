Fragment B carries both the T-domain and the R-domain. The native R-domain (residues 432-535) mediates the binding of diphtheria toxin to its cell surface receptor, a heparin binding epidermal growth factor precursor (hb-EGF). In 1986, Murphy and co-workers pioneered the use of diphtheria toxin as a structural platform to genetically construct a family of fusion proteins toxins. These chimeric toxins were constructed by the genetic deletion of the portion of the toxin structural gene encoding the native R-domain and its replacement with a synthetic gene encoding a surrogate receptor binding domain. The resulting fusion protein toxin is thereby directed to and selectively cytotoxic for only those target cells which express the appropriate targeted cell surface receptor. These fusion protein toxins have proved to be useful to probes in cell biology, in the study of the mechanism of toxin entry into the cytosol, and in one instance as a novel therapeutic which is now used in clinical medicine. DAB389IL-2 (ONTAK(R)), was approved in 1999 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CD25 positive refractory cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and targets the recombinant fusion protein toxin to cells that display the high affinity IL-2 receptor.
