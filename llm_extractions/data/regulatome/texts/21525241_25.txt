cTAGE5 is required for collagen VII secretion from the ER. (A) HeLa cells were transfected with control siRNA or cTAGE5 siRNA (1825) or cTAGE5 siRNA (91). After 70 h, the cells were fixed and stained with anti-cTAGE5 CT antibody and TANGO1 antibodies. Bars, 10 mum. (B) HeLa cells transfected with control siRNA or cTAGE5 siRNA (1825) or cTAGE5 siRNA (91) were extracted and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-cTAGE5 CC1, TANGO1, Sec31A, Sec24D, and beta-actin antibodies. Asterisks indicate nonspecific signals. (C) A431 cells were transfected with control siRNA or cTAGE5 siRNA and stained with anti-collagen VII or anti-cTAGE5 CT antibodies. (D) HSC-1 cells were transfected with control siRNA or cTAGE5 siRNA and stained with anti-collagen VII or anti-cTAGE5 CT antibodies. (E) Quantification of collagen VII immunofluorescence signal per cell in HSC-1 cells (A.U.). The detailed procedure is described in Materials and Methods. Error bars represent mean +/- SEM; **p < 0.005 compared with control siRNA, n = 42. (F) HeLa cells were either transfected with control or cTAGE5 siRNA (1825) or cTAGE5 siRNA (91). After 46 h, cells were cultured with medium without methionine and cysteine for 1 h and then labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min. Cells were washed and then chased for 3 h. Medium was collected and precipitated with TCA and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Cell lysates were extracted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-cTAGE5 CC1 and beta-actin antibodies. BFA was added to the nontransfected cells and kept throughout the chase.
