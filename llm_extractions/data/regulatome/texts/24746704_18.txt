In order to assay the induction of CRAF kinase activity, we performed in vitro kinase reactions, with CRAF that was immunoprecipitated from cells treated with a MEK inhibitor and a kinase-dead recombinant MEK1 as a substrate. In agreement with the conclusion above, PD0325901 treatment increased CRAF activity over time in KRAS mutant models, whereas only a small induction was noted in BRAFV600E cells (Figure 2B and Figure S2E). Thus, compared to cells harboring BRAFV600E, KRAS mutant cells have more pronounced reactivation of CRAF after inhibition of ERK signaling, which in turn mediates the rebound in ERK phosphorylation.
