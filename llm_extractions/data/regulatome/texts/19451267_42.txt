Previous reports have revealed pathogenic roles for TLR7 in lupus nephritis. Overexpression of TLR7 in the Yaa or transgenic mice predisposes to lupus nephritis, whereas the lack of the TLR7 gene ameliorates disease progression in lupus-prone mice. DCs need to have a mechanism limiting TLR7 activation. Overexpression of TLR9 inhibits TLR7 responses. Another mechanism has been revealed in this study that TLR7 responsiveness was down-regulated by the N-terminal cytoplasmic portion of Unc93B1. Given the reciprocal link between TLR7 and 9, Unc93B1 balances TLR7 and 9 to warrant sufficient TLR7 responsiveness without detrimental autoimmune responses (Fig. S6).
