A criterion for validation and selection of new drug targets is to determine whether there is evidence of the reversal of the transformation phenotype using genetic means or drug leads. We have been able to knock down the expression of PLCdelta4 in PLCdelta4 overexpressing cells by transfecting siRNAs specific for PLCdelta4 sequences (Figure 10); however, no reduction in ErbB1 expression level and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in PLCdelta4 overexpressing cells in the presence of siRNA could be detected. The growth signaling responses induced by PLCdelta4 are hence not reversible by siRNA. The inability for siRNAs for PLCdelta4 to knock down growth signaling responses suggests PLCdelta4 may play a role in the initiation of carcinogenesis by inducing other genetic changes, as a neoplastic state can sometimes be irreversible by becoming independent of the initiating oncogenic event through induction of genome destabilization. For instance, even transient induction of MYC activity was able to sustain tumorigenesis in certain cell types. Overexpression of ErbB2, a receptor induced by PLCdelta4 (Figure 6), has also been associated with genetic instability in cells. These results suggest that PLCdelta4 per se may be a difficult target to be manipulated with drugs, and the sites for intervention may lie instead on other enzyme targets in pathways activated by PLCdelta4, such as the ErbB receptors and the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase cascade. The validation of some these targets has been confirmed with two approved drugs, Herceptin(R) specific for ErbB2 and Iressa(R) for EGFR tyrosine kinase, with numerous inhibitors for the ErbB receptor family in clinical trials, and with the studies of Raf inhibitor BAY 37-9751 and MEK inhibitor CI-1040 along the ERK pathway in clinical trials.
