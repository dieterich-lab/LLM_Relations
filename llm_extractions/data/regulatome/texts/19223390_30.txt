Activity of the Shh pathway is a key regulator of DV patterning within the neural tube, and the observed changes in Ptch1 and Shh expression in hitchhiker mutants prompted us to examine the expression of markers of DV patterning at E10.5. As anticipated from the expansion of Shh mRNA expression, we detected dorsal expansion of both Shh and Foxa2 protein expression, markers of floor plate, in the lumbar neural tube of hitchhiker mutants (Fig. 5A-D), although the region that exhibits the columnar morphology characteristic of floor plate appears to be unaltered. In addition, Nkx2.2, which marks the progenitors of the V3 ventral interneurons adjacent to the floor plate, and Nkx6.1, and Olig2 which mark other ventral and ventro-lateral neurons, are all expanded dorsally in hitchhiker mutant embryos (Fig. 5E-J). HB9/MNR2 and Islet1/2, markers of differentiating motorneurons, were also ectopically expressed in dorsally extended domains in hitchhiker mutants (Fig. 5K-N). Correspondingly, markers of dorso-lateral and dorsal neurons, Pax6, Pax7 and Msx, exhibited smaller expression domains in hitchhiker mutants, with a dorsal shift in their ventral limit of expression (Fig. 5O-T). Patterning of the neural tube at more cranial spinal levels was largely unaffected in hitchhiker mutants (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2). Thus, our data reveal ventralization of the caudal neural tube in hitchhiker mutants, consistent with Tulp3 acting as a negative regulator of the Shh pathway.
