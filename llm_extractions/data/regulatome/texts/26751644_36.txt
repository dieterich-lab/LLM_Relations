Our analysis in Xenopus embryos provides evidence that Tet, Tdg and Neil2 interplay is of physiological relevance for neural crest formation during early development. In addition, Tdg and Neil2 are required and cooperate to maintain normal levels of 5fC and 5caC in vivo. An unanswered question is if these two biological roles of Tdg and Neil2 - neural crest formation and 5fC and 5caC processing - are linked. It is generally difficult to pinpoint the role of genes with multiple functions and functional redundancies in vivo. For example, Tet proteins function not only enzymatically but can also act non-enzymatically in transcriptional regulation. Moreover, 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC may not only act as demethylation intermediates but also as epigenetic marks in their own right since they are recognized by specific readers. Thus, it is unclear whether the Tet mutant phenotypes are due to DNA hypermethylation, failure to set oxidized methylcytosine epigenetic marks, or defects in transcription. In addition, Tet1 and Tet2 single-mutant mice are viable, while a fraction of Tet1 and Tet2 double knockout mice die perinatally with developmental abnormalities, indicative of functional redundancy. Tet3 single mutants die perinatally and triple mutants have not been reported. Similarly, Tdg not only functions in Tet-Tdg demethylation but also as a generic mismatch DNA repair enzyme. Moreover, like Tets, TDG can also act non-enzymatically as a scaffold protein to recruit the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300 to numerous transcription factors. Thus, while Tdg knock out mice die in utero, the etiology is unclear.
