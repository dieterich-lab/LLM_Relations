It is possible that we were unable to identify specific mutations to Ebi3 or p35 that affect IL-35 pairing because multiple weak interactions are collectively required to mediate Ebi3:p35 pairing and thus single point mutations are insufficient. Thus multiple mutations within a region may be required to exert an effect. In an effort to more thoroughly examine potential Ebi3:p35 interaction sites, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of p35. Residues that were conserved between mp35 and hp35, and surface exposed in the IL-12 p35 structure were included in the alanine scan. Fifteen different mutant constructs (A1-A15) with between four and seven mutations in each construct where generated, for a total of 78 mutations (Supplemental Fig. 2A). In an effort to prevent misfolding of the mutant proteins, hydrophobic residues were replaced with alanine, while polar or charged residues were replaced with serine.
