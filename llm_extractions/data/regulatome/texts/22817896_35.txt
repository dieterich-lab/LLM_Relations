To determine the functional role of RHIMs in the assembly of the amyloidal RIP1/RIP3 complex in vivo, we introduced selected mutations within and flanking the RHIMs that were shown to cause disruption of filament formation and mutual interaction in vitro (Figure 1B). For RIP3, we stimulated HeLa cells transfected with WT and mutant RIP3-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) with TNF, zVAD-fmk, and LBW242. As expected, WT RIP3-transfected cells underwent cell death, whereas the RHIM AAAA mutant was highly protected. Importantly, RIP3 mutants V458P, V460P, and G457D protected cells from TNF-induced necrosis, whereas the mutant N464D that did not show significant defects in vitro behaved most similar to the WT (Figure 7A). In addition, mutants V458P and V460P completely abolished puncta formation in response to necrosis stimulation, whereas G457D partially disrupted RIP3 clustering (Figure 7B). On the other hand, N464D still formed puncta (Figure 7B). Expression of RIP3-YFP in 293T cells showed that the mutations V458P and V460P severely compromised RIP3 kinase activation by using myelin basic protein (MBP) as the substrate (Figure S7A). To further validate the results from transient expression, we stably reconstituted RIP3-/- fibroblasts with WT and mutant RIP3. In agreement with results in 293T cells, WT RIP3 showed robust kinase activity upon induction of necrosis, whereas the V458P, V460P, and G457D mutants were dramatically impaired in kinase activation (Figure 7C). Notably, there is a close correlation between in vitro and in vivo experiments. For instance, V460P is the most defective in fibril formation and RIP1 interaction in vitro (Figure S5D; note the weakest RIP3 band in the fibril fraction) and is the most defective in cell death induction and kinase activation. Similarly, G457D is a less defective mutant in cell death induction and is also less impaired in kinase activation and cluster formation (Figures 7A-7C).
