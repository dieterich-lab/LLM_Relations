We recently identified TRC8 as the ubiquitin E3 ligase recruited by human cytomegalovirus-encoded US2 for the ERAD of MHC-I molecules. TRC8 is an ER-resident E3 ligase, which we found to associate with the intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl protease SPP, suggesting a potential role for this protease in the ERAD of client substrate proteins. To determine whether SPP plays a role in the dislocation of proteins from the ER membrane into the cytosol, we generated a conditional knockout of SPP in the epithelial colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116. LoxP-flanking sites were engineered into one of the two targeting constructs, which allowed for its later removal after introduction of Cre recombinase (Figs. S1 and S2 and Tables S1-S3).
