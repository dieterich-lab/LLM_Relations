P-REX2a is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the RAC guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) which was discovered in a search for proteins with sequence similarity to the leukocyte-specific RAC GEF, P-REX1. P-REX1 GEF activity is critical for RAC-mediated formation of reactive oxygen species in response to PIP3 and Gbetagamma signaling in neutrophils. P-REX1 expression is increased in metastatic prostate cancers and has been shown to mediate a RAC dependent metastatic and invasive phenotype in prostate cancer cell lines. P-REX2a is a widely expressed paralog of P-REX1 and contains an N-terminal Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology (DHPH) domain [which confers GEF activity], pairs of PDZ and DEP domains, and a C-terminus with weak similarity to inositol 4-polyphosphate phosphatase.
