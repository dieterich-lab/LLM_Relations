The Tah18-interacting protein Dre2 was reported to be involved in cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis. Interestingly, the authors suggest a possible role for Dre2 in iron binding and iron reduction that would need a source of electrons for reductase activity. It is tempting to speculate that Tah18 is able to provide electrons for this reaction, as we have shown that Tah18 and Dre2 interact in vivo. Therefore, it is possible that the Dre2-Tah18 complex might be involved in iron reduction. This also raises the possibility that the release of bound iron from Dre2 might be affected by its interaction with Tah18, resulting in an increased production of hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction. A separate study made a link between DNA replication and Fe/S clusters, and we also found a genetic link between POL3 and NBP35, another Fe/S cluster protein also involved in Fe/S proteins biogenesis in the cytosol. Still, the exact relationship between Dre2-Tah18 and DNA metabolism is largely unknown despite preliminary evidence and has to be further explored.
