Once inside the cell, vitamin A can be metabolized by several different enzymes; however, only some cell types have the ability to metabolize vitamin A to RA during development and in the adult. In numerous cell types RDH10 (short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase, retinol dehydrogenase 10; GENE ID: 98711) is the primary enzyme that metabolizes vitamin A to retinaldehyde in a NAD+ dependent manner. Subsequently, RA is formed by oxidation of retinaldehyde, primarily via ALDH1a2 (RALDH2) (GENE ID:19378) (Fig. 1). Thus, biologically active retinoids are generally synthesized locally. How this metabolism of vitamin A to RA is regulated is an important topic that requires further research.
