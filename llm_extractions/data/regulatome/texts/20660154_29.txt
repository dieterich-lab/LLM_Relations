To analyze the mechanism of mDia2 localization in cytokinesis, we first examined the requirement of Rho for the mDia2 localization, because mDia2 binds to RhoA. During cytokinesis, RhoA is activated by guanine nucleotide exchange facter (GEF), Ect2. We therefore inhibited the Rho-signaling by depletion of Ect2 and analyzed the localization of mDia2 in cell division. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with siRNA for Ect2, and the cells were synchronized in mitotic phase and stained for RhoA and mDia2 (Figure 1A). In control RNAi cells, signals of RhoA and mDia2 were observed at the cleavage furrow at the equatorial cell cortex. In Ect2-RNAi cells, the signals of RhoA at the equatorial cell cortex decreased as previously reported (Figure 1A left), and the signals of mDia2 at the cleavage furrow diminished, and instead accumulated at the interdigitating microtubules of the central spindle (Figure 1A right and S2A-B). These results indicate that mDia2 localizes to the cleavage furrow in a Rho activity-dependent manner. Therefore, we next used a Rho-binding defective mutant of GFP-mDia2, and examined whether the Rho-binding activity of mDia2 is required for the localization of mDia2 in cytokinesis. A mutation into V161 of mDia1 has been shown to render mDia1 RhoA-binding defective. We first confirmed in vitro that a mutation into V180D of mDia2 (analogous to the aforementioned mDia1 V161D mutant) also rendered mDia2 RhoA-binding defective as mDia1 (Figure S1). We found that GFP-mDia2 V180D did not localize at the cleavage furrow, but accumulated at the central spindle (Figure 1B). In addition, this mutant could not effectively rescue the cytokinesis failure induced by depletion of mDia2 (Figure 1C). These results together suggest that the binding between RhoA and mDia2 is essential for the localization and function of mDia2 in cytokinesis.
