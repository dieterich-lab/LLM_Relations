Amino acids regulate the interaction between multiple critical components of the amino acid pathway. Likewise, amino acid deprivation strongly increased the GATOR2-Sestrin2 interaction, whether monitored by immunoprecipitating GATOR2 or Sestrin2 and probing for endogenous Sestrin2 or GATOR2, respectively (Figure 1D, 1E). Pretreatment of cells with rapamycin, an allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor, or Torin1, an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, did not prevent the amino acid-induced decrease in the GATOR2-Sestrin2 interaction, indicating that mTORC1 activity does not control the interaction (Figure S1C). Consistent with the notion that the pathways upstream of mTORC1 that sense amino acids and growth factors are largely independent, insulin treatment of cells did not regulate the Sestrin2-GATOR2 interaction (Figure 1E). Interestingly, however, glucose deprivation led to a modest increase in the amount of Sestrin2 bound to GATOR2, albeit to a much lesser extent than that caused by amino acid starvation (Figure 1E). Glucose levels have been previously described as an upstream input to the Ragulator-v-ATPase input to Rag GTPases, and these results are consistent with glucose also affecting the GATOR2 input to the Rags.
