In ERalpha-negative RL95-2 cells, the expression levels of phosphorylated ERK and phosphorylated FAK at Y397 substantially increased after treatment of either E2, G1 (a GPR30 agonist) or tamoxifen (OHT, ERalpha antagonist) for 5 minutes ( Figs. 2A and 2C ). Similar results were also observed in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells which were both ERalpha-positive and GPR30-positive ( Figs. 2B and 2D ). Using a specific shRNA or siRNA targeting GPR30, the endogenous expression of GPR30 was suppressed in both RL95-2 and Ishikawa cells ( Figs. 2E and 2F ). Subsequently, E2-induced phosphorylation of FAK at Y397 were abolished in cells with GPR30 knockdown ( Figs. 2E and 2F ). These findings suggest that E2-induced FAK phosphorylation at Y397 was mediated through GPR30 (the non-genomic estrogenic signaling pathway) in GPR30-positive endometrial cancer cells with or without the nuclear ERalpha receptor. However, knockdown of ERalpha using siRNA partially abolished phosphorylation of FAK induced by E2 and OHT in Ishikawa cells (GPR30-positive and ERalpha-positive) ( Fig. 2G ). Similarly, E2- and OHT-induced phosphorylation of FAK was also blocked in the presence of ICI 182780 (an antagonist of ERalpha) ( Fig. 2H ). Collectively, E2 and OHT may induce phosphorylation of FAK through both GPR30 and nuclear ERalpha.
