To examine the direct interaction between Ubl4a and the BAG6 BAGS domain, we purified recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli and performed GST pull-down analysis (Fig. 1D). The GST-BAGS domain of BAG6 co-precipitated with full-length Ubl4a, clearly indicating that BAG6 and Ubl4a directly interact with each other. Moreover, Ubl4a was recognized exclusively by the BAGS domain of BAG6, whereas BAG domains derived from BAG1, BAG2, BAG3, BAG4, and BAG5 (Fig. 1D), as well as the full-length form of BAG1 (Fig. 1E), failed to interact with Ubl4a. These results suggest that the BAG6 BAGS domain is distinct from other canonical BAG family members.
