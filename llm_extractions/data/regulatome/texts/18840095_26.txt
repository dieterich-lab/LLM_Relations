Mediator is large protein complex that has been proposed to be necessary for most, if not all, of Pol II-mediated transcription. However, several studies have shown that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Mediator recruitment does not always correlate with transcription activity or the recruitment of the GTF complex. Fan et al. have suggested that Mediator might be selectively associated with genes that are activated by environmental stress or suboptimal growth conditions. Given that the ChIP data indicated an increase in recruitment of GTFs to the ASNS promoter region following UPR activation, the question of Mediator recruitment was also addressed. The RNA Pol II data (Figure 4A) are shown to demonstrate additional recruitment of the pre-initiation complex to the ASNS promoter during ER stress. ASNS (Figure 1, left hand panels) and BiP/GRP78 (Figure 4, Panel C) transcription activity is presented to demonstrate increased transcription from the promoters of these genes following UPR activation. The ChIP results shown in Figure 4 indicated that, despite the fact that some of the basal values obtained were above the background established by the non-specific IgG antibody, during ER stress there is no enhanced recruitment of the MED1, MED23 and CDK8 (cyclin-dependent kinase 8) Mediator subunits to the ASNS promoter at 1 h or 8 h (Figure 4B). In contrast to the ASNS promoter, ChIP analysis of the BiP/GRP78 promoter revealed a trend toward a greater degree of Mediator association after ER stress, occurring at 1 h for MED1 and CDK8 and at 8 h for all three subunits tested (Figure 4D). However, only the MED1 values at 8 h reached statistical significance.
