In conclusion, we have established that the ability of Sprouty2 to act as an inhibitor of B-Raf activity and the MAPK pathway is under dual control by two independent mechanisms: post-translational phosphorylation of Sprouty2 and B-Raf kinase conformation. The phosphorylation status of specific residues on Sprouty2 influences its ability to interact with B-Raf and to modulate MAPK activation in response to growth factors, while evidence suggests that the active B-Raf kinase conformation independently prevents association with Sprouty2. Delineation of the precise signaling pathway leading to Sprouty phosphorylation is an important future goal in light of the important implications these findings have for MAPK signaling in normal and cancer cells.
