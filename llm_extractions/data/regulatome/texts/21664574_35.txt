At steady-state, GGA3 is predominantly localized to the trans-Golgi network,, however a subpopulation of GGA3 localizes to vesicles, previously defined as early endosomal in nature. This is consistent with our observations that GGA3 is enriched in Rab4, and to a lesser extent, Rab5 -positive early endosomes and co-localizes with endocytosed Met cargo in these endosomes. Rab4 is a regulator of recycling vesicle formation at the early endosome, consistent with our functional assignment of GGA3 as an early recycling adaptor for Met. Furthermore, GGA3 may spatially restrict Met accessibility within the early endosome by modulating the Rab-based protein machinery. In this regard, GGA3 binds Rabaptin-5, which can complex with Rab4 and Rab5 as well as the GDP/GTP exchange factor, Rabex-5. Interestingly, GGA1 has been observed in association with clathrin on dynamic and rapid recycling structures. Similarly in live cells, we observe GGA3 and clathrin in dynamic structures surrounding endocytosed HGF-Met complexes. Although we failed to observe GGA1 recruitment to Met, given the high degree of structural homology of GGA family proteins, these results support a role for other GGA family proteins in rapid recycling pathways.
