As the siRNA did not completely abolish APT-1 and 2 we used newly synthesized APT-1 and 2 inhibitors ML348 and ML349, which have very strong substrate inhibition. These compounds were specifically designed for studying these proteins and their specificity and in vivo APT-1 and 2 inhibition has been confirmed in previous studies. ML348 and ML349 did not cause any decrease in cell viability or consistent changes in the main NRAS down streamers ERK and AKT. Though higher concentrations of the two compounds might affect cell biology, the use of ML348 and ML349 in supplemented media is limited by drug solubility. On the other hand, both compounds showed very high and selective bioactivity scores at 5 muM in HEK293T cells and we expect that similar substrate inhibition is achieved in melanoma cells. ML348 and ML349's lack of significant effects are in line with our siRNA studies and suggest a negligible effect of APT-1 and 2 inhibition in NRAS mutant melanoma growth and downstream signaling.
