Next, we examined the effects of gefitinib and 17-AAG, separately and together, on EGFR activation status and on constitutive activation of the prosurvival Akt and Stat3 downstream-signalling pathways, previously shown to be key mediators of mutant EGFR-dependent tumorigenesis. Although not all exon 20 insertion mutants were equally active, their expression in COS7 cells led to equivalent upregulation of the steady-state phosphorylation of endogenous Akt and/or Stat3-signalling proteins (Figure 1B). EGFR/D770insNPG, the most active mutant, was insensitive to gefitinib (0.1 muM, 5 h), as were the less active mutants EGFR/D770InsNPH and EGFR/M766InsASV. Surprisingly, the activity of EGFR/V738InsKIPVAI was inhibited by gefitinib, as was the activation status of both downstream effectors Akt and Stat3. However, all four EGFR insertion mutants were quite sensitive to 17-AAG (0.5 muM, 5 h), as the steady-state level of both total and phosphorylated EGFR declined markedly after Hsp90 inhibitor treatment. The uniform downregulation of all autophosphorylated docking sites in EGFR suggests that Hsp90 inhibition effectively uncouples the kinase from its various downstream-signalling pathways. In support of this hypothesis, 17-AAG inhibited the activation of Akt and Stat3 independent of the particular EGFR insertion mutant under examination, and with the possible exception of EGFR/V738InsKIPVAI, its activity did not appear to be additive with that of gefitinib. For comparison, the effect of 17-AAG on wild-type EGFR and several downstream-signalling pathways is shown in Figure 1C. Stat3 phosphorylation remains sensitive to 17-AAG, even in the absence of wild-type EGFR downregulation. From these data, we conclude that EGFR exon 20 insertion mutants, even though they resist inhibition by gefinitib, depend strongly on association with Hsp90 for their stability and function. Brief exposure to a clinically achievable concentration of 17-AAG promoted rapid downregulation of their activity and the activity of two important downstream-signalling pathways.
