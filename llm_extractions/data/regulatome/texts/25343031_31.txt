The MTCs of the endosomes, HOPS and CORVET, have attracted considerable interest recently. Originally identified in yeast as a class of the Vps mutants, variants have now been identified in a range of higher eukaryotes, including humans. CORVET and HOPS act sequentially and coordinate fusion events associated with the early/late endosomes and the lysosome. Both complexes are heterohexamers and share a common set of four Vps proteins (VPS11, VPS16, VPS18, and VPS33), and both interact with GTP-Rabs and SNAREs. Two isoforms of VPS16 and VPS33 have been described in metazoans. Mutation in any of the core subunits results in loss of both CORVET and HOPS complexes and severe defects in endosomal biogenesis and vacuolar morphology in yeast. Loss-of-function mutants in higher eukaryotes for HOPS or CORVET either are embryonic lethal or cause severe developmental defects. Furthermore, mutations in VPS33 and 16 have been linked to diseases, including cancer. In addition to the four common core subunits, both complexes contain two additional subunits (CORVET Vps8 and VPs3 and HOPS Vps41 and Vps39) that are unique to each complex and account for their specific Rab-binding properties. CORVET is a Rab5 effector, whereas HOPS is a Rab7 effector. The interactions with Rabs and SNAREs account for their capacity to tether membranes and for their defined location on early or late endosomes/lysosomes, respectively.
