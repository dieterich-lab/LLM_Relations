Given that both alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta1 can interact with L1-Ig6, we wished to determine why alphavbeta3 is the dominant integrin in wild-type ECV304 cell adhesion (Fig. 5 B). In this regard, we tested the hypothesis that exogenous calcium may favor the use of alphavbeta3 rather than alphavbeta1. We observed a number of facts supporting this hypothesis. First, significant alphavbeta1 binding could be induced in the wild-type cells, but only in the presence of Mn2+ alone (Fig. 6 A). Thus, whereas wild-type ECV304 cell adhesion in the presence of Ca2+ could be abrogated with anti-alphavbeta3 mAb LM609 (Fig. 5 B), the adhesion of these cells in the presence of Mn2+ alone could only be blocked using a combination of antibodies reactive with both alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta1 (i.e., LM609 and P4C10), or with a mAb reactive with both alphav integrins (i.e., 17E6) (Fig. 6 A, right). Second, minimal wild-type adhesion was observed in the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+ alone and this appeared to be fully dependent upon alphavbeta3 (Fig. 6 A). Finally, in an experiment analogous to that performed with the wild-type CHO cells (Fig. 2 B), we observed that the alphavbeta1-mediated (Mn2+-dependent) adhesion of the sorted, alphavbeta3-negative endothelial cells was significantly more susceptible to inhibition by exogenous Ca2+ than the wild-type adhesion (Fig. 6 B). Together these data indicate that in the absence of alphavbeta3 expression, quiescent endothelial cells may use alphavbeta1 to bind to L1, however with the induction of alphavbeta3 expression, physiological levels of calcium are likely to favor the use of this integrin. It is also clear that whereas alphavbeta1-mediated adhesion is susceptible to inhibition by exogenous Ca2+, this inhibition is less pronounced than that seen when adhesion is mediated via alpha5beta1 (Fig. 2 B).
