In conclusion, this study reveals an integral and general role of oligo-uridylation in mammalian mRNA decay (model shown in Figure 7). Upon deadenylation, mRNAs (with A-tails shorter than ~25 nt) lose PABP and instead gain a U-tail by the redundant action of TUT4 and TUT7. The oligo-U-tail triggers decay by serving as a mark that is recognized by downstream decay factors. Thus, TUT4/7 function as the "writers" of the decay mark. It will be interesting in the future to identify the "readers" of the oligo-U-tail and to ask if this modification can be reversed by "erasers." The LSM1-7 complex and DIS3L2 are likely candidates that recognize the oligo-U marks, but further investigations will be necessary to understand which factor(s) recognize the oligo-U-tails mainly, whether there is any additional factor(s) that binds to the oligo-U-tails, and what is the molecular basis of the specific recognition.
