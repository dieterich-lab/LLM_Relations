As shown in Supplementary Table 1, NF1 mutations were also detected in cells that harbored inactivating BRAF mutations. While the kinase activity of these BRAF proteins is compromised, they have been proposed to function as scaffolds that translocate CRAF to the membrane and promote CRAF activation downstream of KRAS. Notably, the oncogenic effects of these mutants are significantly enhanced in the presence of KRASG12D. Similarly, an NF1 mutation might be expected to function as an alternative mechanism of activating KRAS, and also potentiate the effects of these BRAF mutants. To evaluate the contribution of RAS isoforms in human melanomas we examined WM3629 cells. Interestingly, in addition to harboring the kinase-dead BRAFD594G mutation and an NF1 deletion, this cell line also possesses an activating NRASG12D mutation. The WM3670 line similarly harbors an inactivating BRAF mutation, as well as NF1 and NRASG12D mutations. Consistent with the presence of these mutations and our previous observations, NRAS, KRAS, and HRAS are all activated in WM3629 cells. Moreover, shRNA-mediated ablation of all three RAS isoforms, H-, K-, and NRAS, suppressed the ability of WM3629 cells to proliferate and form colonies in soft agar (Fig. 7F-H). These results further demonstrate that neurofibromin critically regulates H- and KRAS in melanomas and suggest that in the presence of NRAS mutations all three RAS isoforms cooperate with inactivating BRAF mutations to promote tumorigenesis.
