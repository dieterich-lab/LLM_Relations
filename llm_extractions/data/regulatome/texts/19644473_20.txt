mTOR plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation by monitoring nutrient availability, cellular energy levels, oxygen levels, and mitogenic signals (reviewed in REF). Notably, mTOR belongs to a group of Ser/Thr protein kinases of the PI3K superfamily referred to as class IV PI3Ks, including ATM, ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related), DNA-PK and SMG-1 (SMG1 homolog, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase). mTOR exists in two distinct complexes - mTORC1 and mTORC2. The mTORC1 complex is composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit, Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR), PRAS40 (proline-rich AKT substrate 40 kDa) and the protein mLST8/GbL (reviewed in REF ). mTORC2 is composed of mTOR, Rictor (rapamycin insensitive companion of mTOR), mSIN1 (mammalian stress-activated protein kinase interacting protein 1) and mLST8/GbL .
