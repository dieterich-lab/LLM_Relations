It has been reported that TAK1 is required for IKK and JNK activation by TCR stimulation, and the TAK1-TAB1 complex is sufficient for NFAT activation in Jurkat cells. Because USP18 deficiency potentiated activation of molecules such as IKK, JNK, and NFAT distal from TCR, but not TCR-proximal signaling complex ZAP70 or PLC-gamma, we reasoned that USP18 might target some key molecules in between the proximal and distal signaling complexes, of which TAK1 is a promising candidate. We thus tested whether TAK1 was hyperactivated in USP18KO T cells. Results from the in vitro kinase assay indicated that the kinase activity of TAK1 was significantly increased in USP18KO cells compared with WT cells stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 (Fig. 8 A).
