The following three experiments demonstrated that both 5- and 4-Pase interact with Rab5 directly and specifically. First, we used a GST-Rab5 pull-down assay. Both recombinant 5- and 4-Pases bound to beads containing GST-Rab5 preloaded with GTPgammaS but not GDP (Fig. 3 C). Second, the specificity of such interaction was verified using the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the beta-galactosidase replica filter assay (Fig. 3, D and E), blue colonies were obtained only upon cotransformation of prey plasmids (5- and 4-Pase) with bait vectors expressing wild-type Rab5 (WT)or activated Rab5 Q79L (QL) but neither from dominant negative Rab5 S34N (SN), nor Rab4 (WT, Q67L, S22N) transformants. Third, we tested the ability of Rab5:GTP to recruit 5- and 4-Pase onto endosomes in vivo. Whereas both endogenous and overexpressed 5- and 4-Pases were predominantly cytosolic, a fraction was recruited onto the membrane of enlarged endosomes specifically upon coexpression of the activated Rab5 Q79L mutant in HeLa cells (Fig. 3 F). Combined with the data of Fig. 2, these results suggest that the 5- and 4-Pases interact in a GTP-dependent manner, directly and specifically with Rab5 both in vitro and in vivo.
