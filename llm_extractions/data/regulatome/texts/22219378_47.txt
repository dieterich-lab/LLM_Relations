Our next goal was to identify the region within the C-terminal part of EPI64 (319-508) that is required for interaction with JFC1. We made GST-tagged constructs with truncations from both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends and used them to precipitate Myc-JFC1 from a HeLa cell lysate (Figure 6C). This analysis showed that EPI64 residues 319-396 and 451-508 were not necessary for the interaction (Figure 6C). In additional experiments, GST-JFC1-SHD was able to precipitate GFP-EPI64 residues 319-481 and GFP-EPI64 residues 424-508 from HeLa cells (Supplemental Figure S5A). The combined results suggest that the 28-residue region 424-451 in EPI64 is necessary for binding to JFC1. Consistent with this, HXP-EPI64 lacking residues 421-453 (HXP-EPI64-Delta421-453; Figure 6D) expressed in HeLa cells had a greatly diminished ability to be recovered by GST-JFC1-SHD (Figure 6E).
