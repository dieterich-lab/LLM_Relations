Mechanistically, loss of DAB2ip appears to promote both transformation and tumor metastasis. Short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of DAB2ip in human prostate epithelial cells results in metastatic prostate cancer, when injected into mice. Reexpression of a catalytically inactive form of DAB2ip containing a GAP domain point mutation does not suppress tumor growth in vivo but does inhibit metastasis. Conversely, reexpression of a catalytically active form of DAB2ip containing a point mutation in its C-terminal region, which abrogates its ability to inhibit NF-kappaB, inhibits tumor growth but not metastasis. Together, these findings indicate that DAB2ip inhibits tumor growth by suppressing Ras and inhibits metastasis by suppressing NF-kappaB. In addition, the ability of DAB2ip to suppress PI3K and the PKB pathway and to promote ASK activation in prostate epithelial cells likely contributes to its function as a tumor suppressor. Increased activation of NF-kappaB in DAB2ip-deficient prostate epithelial cells results in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), marked by increased mesenchymal marker abundance on prostate epithelial cells, which is associated with metastasis, and that suggests that DAB2ip inhibits EMT and metastasis.
