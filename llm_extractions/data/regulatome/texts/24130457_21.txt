Mapping the site of PHear interaction to the beta2-linker by overlay allowed us to confirm the interaction using in-solution affinity selection assays. GST-beta2-linker specifically bound NECAP 1 from brain extracts with binding similar to that seen for clathrin, the only other protein known to interact with the beta2-linker (Figure 2F). NMR analysis reveals that the beta2-linker binds a site on PHear that overlaps with the interface for FxDxF motifs (Figure 2G-I) and titrations of beta2-linker with PHear reveal a mean KD of 480 microM (Figure 2J,K). While the affinity of PHear for the beta2-linker is low in isolation, full-length NECAP 1 has two additional binding sites on AP-2 that provide avidity effects, the low affinity site in Ex and the high affinity WxxF motif at the C-terminus (Figure 1C).
