Human Cdc25A phosphatase has a non-redundant function in G2 phase by activating Cyclin A-dependent kinases.  Cdc25 phosphatases activate Cdk/Cyclin complexes by dephosphorylation and thus promote cell cycle progression. We observed that the peak activity of Cdc25A precedes the one of Cdc25B in prophase and the maximum of Cyclin/Cdk kinase activity. Furthermore, Cdc25A activates both Cdk1-2/Cyclin A and Cdk1/Cyclin B complexes while Cdc25B seems to be involved only in activation of Cdk1/Cyclin B. Concomitantly, repression of Cdc25A led to a decrease in Cyclin A-associated kinase activity and attenuated Cdk1 activation. Our results indicate that Cdc25A acts before Cdc25B - at least in cancer cells, and has non-redundant functions in late G2/early M-phase as a major regulator of Cyclin A/kinase complexes.
