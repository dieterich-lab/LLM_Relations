Sirt6 deficiency exacerbates podocyte injury and proteinuria through targeting Notch signaling.  Podocyte injury is a major determinant of proteinuric kidney disease and the identification of potential therapeutic targets for preventing podocyte injury has clinical importance. Here, we show that histone deacetylase Sirt6 protects against podocyte injury through epigenetic regulation of Notch signaling. Sirt6 is downregulated in renal biopsies from patients with podocytopathies and its expression correlates with glomerular filtration rate. Podocyte-specific deletion of Sirt6 exacerbates podocyte injury and proteinuria in two independent mouse models, diabetic nephropathy, and adriamycin-induced nephropathy. Sirt6 has pleiotropic protective actions in podocytes, including anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, is involved in actin cytoskeleton maintenance and promotes autophagy. Sirt6 also reduces urokinase plasminogen activator receptor expression, which is a key factor for podocyte foot process effacement and proteinuria. Mechanistically, Sirt6 inhibits Notch1 and Notch4 transcription by deacetylating histone H3K9. We propose Sirt6 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of proteinuric kidney disease.Podocytes are essential components of the renal glomerular filtration barrier and podocyte dysfunction leads to proteinuric kidney disease. Here Liu et al. show that Sirt6 protects podocytes from apoptosis and inflammation by increasing autophagic flux through inhibition of the Notch pathway.
