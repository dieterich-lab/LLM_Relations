In order to analyze LigI depletion in the same genetic background, we used HeLa cells to target LigI or LigIII expression by introducing shRNA vectors. We transfected an episomal plasmid to generate a HeLaCTL control cell line expressing a control shRNA, and HeLa LigIKD and LigIIIKD line expressing an shRNA targeting LIGI or LIGIII, respectively. Western blots are presented in Fig. 3b. We observed that in the HeLa LigIKD cells, LigIII immunostaining was mostly diffuse with distinct and intense foci in mid- and late-S-phase cells, while no LigIII staining was observed in the HeLa LigIIIKD cells (Fig. 2b). Depletion of the LigI protein in proliferating HeLa LigIKD cells was found to be associated with an increase in the percentage of nuclei with co-stained for LigIII/PCNA S phase replication foci from 25.5 % in the HeLaCTL cell line to 61 % in HeLa LigIKD cell line (Fig. 2b, c). Taken together, these observations show that the accumulation of the LigIII and XRCC1 proteins to BrdU or PCNA foci in proliferating cells is a conserved response to a LigI deficiency between mouse and human cell lines.
