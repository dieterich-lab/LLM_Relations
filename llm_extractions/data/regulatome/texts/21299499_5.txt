CaM is a widely distributed intracellular sensor of calcium ions. It binds to a wide variety of cellular targets in order to transduce calcium-based signals. A key group of targets in signalling to the cytoskeleton are the IQGAP [IQ-motif-containing GAP (GTPase-activating protein)] family of proteins. These relatively large proteins (150-180 kDa) sit at the interface between cellular signalling and cytoskeletal reorganization. They bind to a variety of signalling molecules (including kinases, growth factor receptors and small GTPases), integrate the information received from them and pass it on to the cytoskeleton. This is achieved by direct interaction with actin, by interaction with actin-organizing proteins such as N-WASP (neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) and by regulation of microtubule-organizing proteins such as CLIP-170 (cytoplasmic linker protein-170) and the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) protein.
