Association of PEGylated Sec61betaOPG variants with endogenous TRC40 was tested by incubating 1-1.9 muM of recombinant modified Sec61betaOPG with 140 mul of rabbit reticulocyte lysate for 30 min at 30 degreesC. Reaction mixtures were then split into two and each half was added to 20 mul [50% (v/v) suspension] of Protein A-Sepharose coated with 7.5 mul of rabbit anti-TRC40 or anti-PDI (protein disulfide-isomerase) antisera. The lysate was incubated with anti-Protein A-Sepharose antibody beads for 1 h at 4 degreesC, the resin was then washed extensively with buffer R (50 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 40 mM potassium acetate and 5 mM MgCl2) supplemented with 0.5 M NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted with buffer R containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 (cf.). The eluate was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, and samples were resolved on SDS/PAGE and immunoblotted with the anti-opsin tag antibody. Quantitative analysis was carried out using a LiCor Biosciences system (described below). The non-specific binding of the indicated Sec61betaOPG variants to anti-PDI antibody-coated Protein A-Sepharose beads was subtracted from the results obtained using anti-TRC40 antibody-coated Protein A-Sepharose, and the resulting values were normalized to the amount of each Sec61betaOPG species present in the starting material (see Supplementary Figure S1 for a full worked example).
