Different results and interpretations on the potential role of actin in clathrin-based endocytosis have accompanied these fundamentally different models for the mechanics of coat assembly. A connection between actin and clathrin-driven membrane uptake was first described in yeast. Acute depolymerization of actin by latrunculin A inhibits clathrin-based endocytosis in some metazoan cells, but not in others. Latrunculin treatment has no detectable effect on the dynamics of endocytic coated pits in BSC1 cells, but it strongly inhibits endocytosis in Swiss 3T3 cells, with a marked reduction in the number of clathrin-based endocytic events. Similarly, perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton by genetic means, such as depletion of Hip1R, perturbations in Hip1R association with cortactin, and depletion of N-WASP, has variable effects that depend on cell type. Some clathrin endocytic structures recruit actin or cortactin at the time they bud and disappear, but others, in the same cells, do not.
