During the initial elucidation of the MAPK pathway, early studies reported C-Raf phosphorylation by ERK in vitro, but the functional significance of this phosphorylation was not determined. Later studies that established the signaling direction from Raf to MEK and from MEK to ERK, diverted the focus from these initial observations, however, they have been confirmed in more recent studies demonstrating that ERK phosphorylates C-Raf at multiple sites, including S289, 296, 301 and S642, providing a feedback regulatory mechanism. Controversy remains, however, as to whether this phosphorylation serves as a positive or negative regulation. Our work points to a positive regulation of C-Raf by ERK-mediated phosphorylation by stabilizing the active form of C-Raf. It is important to note, however, that the ERK-mediated C-Raf phosphorylation does not activate C-Raf or enhances its activation by itself, but it rather prolongs the activation duration induced by growth factors.
