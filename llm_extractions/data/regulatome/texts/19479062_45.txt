Although TRAF6 is clearly involved in the RLH signaling pathway, inhibition of IFN production in response to RNA virus infection due to TRAF6 deficiency was partial in the present study, suggesting the presence of TRAF6-dependent and -independent pathways leading to IFN production. Similarly, type I IFN production has been reported to be partially blocked in Traf3 -/- MEF cells. Furthermore, TRAF3 and TRAF6 independently bind to their own specific binding sites in IPS-1. Therefore, TRAF3 may regulate the TRAF6-independent production of type I IFNs. We also showed that RLH pathway-dependent NF-kappaB activation requires TRAF6 (Figure 3B and 3C), whereas TRAF3 deficiency does not affect the activation of NF-kappaB or expression of NF-kappaB target genes, such as IkappaBalpha . Furthermore, TRAF6-induced activation of IRF is likely to be specific for IRF7, while TRAF3 is thought to activate both IRF3 and IRF7. These results strongly suggest that the TRAF6- and TRAF3-dependent pathways are likely to bifurcate at IPS-1, but to converge later at IRF7 in order to co-operatively induce sufficient production of type I IFNs during RLH signaling.
