Human ArfGAP1 was also found to couple cargo to the COPI coat but did so in a manner that was independent of Arf. Like ArfGAP2/3 orthologs, mammalian ArfGAP1 binds directly to both coatomer and several SNARE proteins and facilitates the interaction between the cargo and the coat. But in contrast to the Glo3/ArfGAP2/3 studies, the ArfGAP1 complex had no requirement for Arf. GAP activity was not required to facilitate the interaction between coat and cargo as shown by use of an ArfGAP1 mutant that lacks catalytic activity, ArfGAP1-R50K. These data suggest that ArfGAP1 has a role in cargo sorting that is independent of both Arf and GAP activity in a manner similar to but different from Glo3. In this model ArfGAP1 forms a priming complex with cargo for the recruitment of coatomer. In either instance, interaction with coatomer and cargo were mediated by regions of Arf GAP outside of the catalytic domain and these effects could be recapitulated with deletion mutants lacking the catalytic domain, further suggesting that these functions can act independently of GAP activity. Thus, ArfGAP1 clearly has the potential to function as an effector of Arf and in processes or pathways that do not involve direct binding to Arf. A more general conclusion that will likely be repeated in other systems and with other Arf GAPs is that the presence of an Arf GAP in a pathway does not in itself establish a role for an Arf in that same pathway.
