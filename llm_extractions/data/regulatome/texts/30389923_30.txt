Based on the observation of dimerized Y288C protein in the Golgi and ER (Fig. 3d), we further investigated the activity of Y288C protein in those two compartments by assessing phosphorylation of Y288C proteins in OptiPrep gradient fractions. Surprisingly, Y288C protein displayed a differential phosphorylation pattern in those two compartments. p-PDGFRA Y572/574 and Y742 were predominantly detected in the Golgi enriched fractions and p-PDGFRA Y720, Y754, and Y1018 were found in both Golgi and ER-enriched fractions (Fig. 4a). Tyrosine phosphorylation of these sites recruits different linker molecules resulting in distinct downstream signaling effects. Y572/574 are docking sites for STATs and Src family members; Y742 interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and activates PI3K signaling; Y720 and Y754 recruit SHP-2 and thereby activate the MAPK signaling cascade; Y1018 associates with PLC-gamma. We thus speculated that the differential phosphorylation pattern of Y288C protein might lead to differential activation of downstream signaling in distinct subcellular compartments. To test this hypothesis, we treated the MCF10A cells expressing PDGFRA WT or Y288C with monensin, which inhibits protein release from Golgi by blocking medial- to trans-Golgi transition, and brefeldin A (BFA), which impedes protein export from the ER. Membrane localization of PDGFRA WT was decreased and both PDGFRA WT and Y288C protein accumulated in Golgi after monensin treatment (Fig. 4b, upper panel). Further, BFA treatment of PDGFRA WT recapitulated the perinuclear location of Y288C protein in untreated cells and increased the colocalization of both PDGFRA WT and Y288C with calnexin (Fig. 4b, lower panel). These results are consistent with the expected effects of monensin and BFA. Phosphorylation of Y288C protein and activation of downstream signaling pathways after monensin and BFA treatments were evaluated by western blotting (Fig. 4c). Monensin caused a band shift and significantly increased phosphorylation of Y288C protein at Y572/574 and its downstream effectors STAT3/5. These effects were completely abolished by BFA, suggesting that enhanced Y288C phosphorylation at Y572/574 in the Golgi, but not in ER activated STAT signaling. Our finding was in line with a previous study which showed that Golgi localized V561D and D842V led to activation of STAT signaling. Y742 phosphorylation demonstrated similar changes to Y572/574 after treatment with monensin or BFA; however, Akt phosphorylation was decreased by monensin and totally eliminated by BFA. This is consistent with Y288C phosphorylation at Y742 on the cell surface or in the Golgi, but not in ER, being able to activate Akt signaling. Monensin and early time points after BFA treatment did not alter size or amount of p-PDGFRA Y720 and Y754. This is consistent with phosphorylation of Y288C at Y720 and Y754 occurring mainly on the high mannose glycosylated receptor in the ER. Inhibition of cell surface PDGFRA localization by monensin or BFA both markedly decreased but did not abolish ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating ERK1/2 could be activated by cell surface PDGFRA as well as by PDGFR in the Golgi or ER (Fig. 4c). Our results revealed the differential phosphorylation of Y288C protein and subsequent activation of a complex signaling network in distinct subcellular compartment which was absent in PDGFRA WT expressing cells.
