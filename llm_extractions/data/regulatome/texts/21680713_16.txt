To investigate further the functional significance of these findings, we extended our studies to human cells. Among human proteins, Drosophila Gish is most similar to the CK1 gamma family of kinases (CK1gamma), which includes three subfamilies (CK1gamma1, CK1gamma2, and CK1gamma3). Although all three kinases exhibit a high degree of homology within the kinase domain, there are significant differences in their N- and C-terminal extensions, which suggests these proteins are functionally distinct. To test whether these kinases can directly phosphorylate Claspin, we prepared recombinant versions of CK1gamma1, CK1gamma2, and CK1gamma3 in Sf9 insect cells and then performed in vitro kinase assays (Figure 3A). In these experiments, we observed that all three kinases could phosphorylate the GST-CKAD fragment well (Figure 3B). In control experiments, we observed that recombinant Chk1 could not phosphorylate this fragment significantly (Figure 3B). Moreover, we demonstrated that the CK1gamma kinases could not phosphorylate a mutant form of the CKAD (2AG) in which the two critical phosphorylation sites (Ser864 and Ser895) had been changed to alanine (Figure 3C). Finally, we also produced wild-type and kinase-dead (N169A mutant) forms of GST-tagged CK1gamma1 in bacteria. We observed that the wild-type GST-CK1gamma1 could phosphorylate Ser864 of Claspin efficiently, whereas the kinase-dead mutant was inactive (Figure 3D).
