The V43I mutation reduced GST-RhoB basal nucleotide exchange activity (Table 2). Further, GST-RhoB-V43I was a poorer substrate for XPLN, Dbl, Dbs and to a lesser extent GEFT, whereas Vav2 was relatively insensitive to the GST-RhoB V43I mutation (Figs. 4 and 5). Although the I43V mutation reduced GST-RhoC basal nucleotide exchange activity (Table 2), it also produced a GTPase that was a significantly better substrate for XPLN, GEFT and Dbl (Fig. 4). Transiently-expressed wild-type Myc- or GFP-tagged RhoC and RhoC-43V, however, exhibited no significant difference in their GTP-loading profile, while Myc-RhoC-43T displayed, as expected, reduced GTP-loading compared with wild-type Myc-RhoC (Fig. 6A and B).
