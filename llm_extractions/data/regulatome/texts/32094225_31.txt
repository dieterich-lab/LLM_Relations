In vitro selection experiments with the coronavirus model murine hepatitis virus resulted in two variants with resistance-conferring mutations in nsp12. These data provide strong evidence to show that RdRp is the target for RDV. Our biochemical data corroborate that the RNA polymerase of MERS-CoV is indeed the drug target. We demonstrate that MERS nsp8 and nsp12 form an active, binary complex. RDV-TP is utilized as a substrate and competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Natural nucleotide pools are commonly more efficiently incorporated when compared with nucleotide analogs. However, in this case, we observe that incorporation of the nucleotide analog is significantly more efficient.
