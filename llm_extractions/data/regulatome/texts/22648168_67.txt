We demonstrate here the identity and mechanisms of endosomal trafficking machinery essential for cortical remodeling and cell protrusion formation. What remains to be determined is the identity of the protein cargo or lipids that mediate the underlying structural remodeling and cell protrusion formation. We envision that trafficking of either a transmembrane receptor or Rac GTPase could localize or activate signaling that controls F-actin regulators at the cortex. An alternative possibility is that the Sbf complex may have a more direct role in the recruitment of F-actin regulators. The assembly of Sbf/MTMR13 protein complexes with different catalytic proteins raises the possibility for a network of interactions affecting Rab and phosphoinositide functions, with implications for the balance of membrane trafficking in both normal and disease states. The expansion of the MTM family in metazoans, including the emergence of MTM pseudophosphatases, points to their likely roles in the regulation of different phosphoinositide pools that meets the membrane-trafficking demands for dynamic cell regulation.
