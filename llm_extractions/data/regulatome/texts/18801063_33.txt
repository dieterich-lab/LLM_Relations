TRAPP I plays an essential role in ER-to-Golgi transport 1, 36, 49, 50. Its role as a tether in this transport step was established by showing that TRAPP I interacts directly with ER-derived vesicles produced using either a crude cytosolic fraction or purified COP II coat components (36). How does TRAPP I interact with vesicles? It was recently reported that ER-derived vesicles bind to TRAPP I through an interaction between the Bet3p subunit and the vesicle coat protein Sec23p (24). This was a surprising result for two reasons. First, it was long assumed that vesicles rapidly uncoat following inactivation of Sar1p by hydrolysis of bound GTP (51). This uncoating is catalyzed by the GTPase-activating protein activity of Sec23p towards Sar1p (52). Using a liposome system, Sato and Nakano (53) showed that the Sec23p/Sec24p complex remains associated with prebudding complexes because of constant reactivation of Sar1p by its GEF, Sec12p. Although Sec12p is not found in transport vesicles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, other factors may stabilize the association of Sec23p with free vesicles as has been suggested to happen in Pichia pastoris and higher eukaryotes 54, 55. Second, an earlier study showed that TRAPP I can bind to COP II vesicles in vitro, but the interaction was blocked by the inclusion of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog (36). The latter result was interpreted as a requirement for vesicle uncoating before the TRAPP I interaction. If, however, sufficient amounts of Sec23p remain associated with free vesicles, then the previous result may reflect the fact that other GTPases are involved in the tethering of these vesicles. In agreement with this idea, it has been shown that the protein GDI interferes with vesicle tethering (56) and GDI binds to the non-activated (GDP-bound) form of the GTPase Ypt1p. However, Ypt1p activation is necessary for vesicle fusion (57). Because Ypt1p is reportedly associated with vesicles (58), it is plausible that premature activation of Ypt1p interferes with vesicle tethering and its GDP-bound form participates in tethering. In this scenario, activated Ypt1p would recruit other factors to the site of the tethered vesicle to further strengthen the tether or aid in SNARE complex assembly.
