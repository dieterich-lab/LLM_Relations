We examined the effect of tsad siRNA-mediated silencing in HDMECs. Whereas VEGF induced a threefold increase in c-Src activation (in relation to total Src protein pool) in control siRNA-transfected cells, silencing of tsad using two different tsad siRNAs perturbed c-Src activation, which increased only marginally or not at all with VEGF treatment (Fig. 4 C). However, the basal level of c-Src p418 was elevated in the tsad siRNA-treated cells relative to control siRNA-treated cells. In contrast, tsad siRNA did not affect VEGF-induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation at pY1175 or phosphorylation of PLCgamma, ERK1/2, or endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Akt was not induced in the HDMECs under the conditions used here irrespective of transfection of siRNA (unpublished data). Similar data were obtained when analyzing VEGF-induced signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells that were transfected or not with tsad siRNA (unpublished data).
