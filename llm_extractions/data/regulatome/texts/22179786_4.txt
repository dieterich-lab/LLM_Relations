Nucleotide misincorporation or strand slippage at repetitive sequences during replication results in mispaired or unpaired DNA bases. Mismatched bases are recognized by MutS, which in the presence of ATP recruits MutL to initiate the repair process --. Eukaryotes have two MutS homologs, alpha and beta. MutSalpha, a heterodimer of MutS homologs Msh2 and Msh6, recognizes a base mispair or 1--2 unpaired bases, like homodimeric bacterial MutS . In contrast, MutSbeta, a heterodimer of Msh2 and Msh3, recognizes insertion-deletion loops (IDL) of 1--15 nucleotides, as well as DNA with a 3' single-stranded overhang --. Inactivation of MutS or MutL by mutation, or reduced expression of human MutLalpha due to promoter hypermethylation, leads to increased mutation rates and microsatellite instability --. In humans such defects are correlated with susceptibility to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch Syndrome . Loss of MSH3 in tumor cells is correlated with increased microsatellite instability of tri- and tetra-nucleotide repeats ( and references therein). Mice with Msh3 knocked out develop cancers only late in life, but a double knockout of Msh3 and Msh6 renders mice far more susceptible to cancer than the single knockout of either gene .
