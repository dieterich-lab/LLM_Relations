The mRNA levels of the transcription factors E2F1 and E2F2 as well as their downstream target MYBL2 (protein name B-MYB) is strongly correlated with expression levels of ATAD2. These patterns for strong correlations are consistently seen during tumor development from precursor lesions of endometrial cancer, complex atypical hyperplasias (A.-C.; n = 18), through primary tumors (D.-F.; n = 176) to metastatic lesions (G.-I.; n = 42).
