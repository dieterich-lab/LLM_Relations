In addition to ligand binding, posttranslational modifications (acetylation and phosphorylation) of ER and its associated co-activators (e.g., SRC1, SRC2, AIB1, p300) and co-repressors (e.g., MTA1, NCoR, and SMRT) play a role in ER action. Histone-modifying enzymes interact with ER and influence its activity and that of its cooperating factors. Yet, how the recruitment of these enzymes is regulated is an open question. Moreover, in response to estrogen treatment, ER can activate a variety of kinases (e.g., MAP kinases, ERK, and AKT) and phosphatases (e.g., PP1, PP2A, and PDXP), which can regulate histone proteins (e.g., Msk1, Msk2, and histone H1) and ER co-regulators. In this section, we review and discuss the importance of these enzymes in modulating ER, ER cooperating partners, and their relevance in hormone-resistant tumors (Fig. 5).
