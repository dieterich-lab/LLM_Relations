In a genome wide study undertaken to identify new candidate genes for human CHDs, we previously screened 58 patients with CHDs and other congenital anomalies with no identified genetic syndrome for CNVs. In a previous publication we described 12 patients with 12 novel CNVs that were absent in over 2,000 ethnically matched controls. As previously described, one patient diagnosed with a posterior malalignment type of ventricular septal defect (pmVSD) had a 4.3-Mb deletion on chromosome 15q25-26 that encompassed 46 genes, including NTRK3 (neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor, type 3; MIM# 191316), which encodes the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor C (TrkC). Originally studied in the development of the nervous system, TrkC and its only ligand, neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) were found to regulate survival and differentiation in developing neural crest cells [reviewed in ]. Upon binding NT-3, TrkC autophosphorylates and activates the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. Although NTRK3 has not yet been associated with human CHDs, animal models support its role in heart development. Indeed, TrkC null (-/-) mice mostly die within the first weeks after birth due to severe cardiac defects. The heart defects seen in these mice resemble those commonly seen in humans, including atrial septal defects (ASD), VSDs, and tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), suggesting that NTRK3 could also play a role in human cardiovascular malformation. Consequently, we chose to study NTRK3 in our patient cohorts for disease-related sequence variations.
