Heterologous expression of alphavbeta8 mediated activation of TGF-beta in HT1080, SW480, and MvLu cells as determined by coculture with either TMLC (Fig. 2, a-d) or HepG2-(SBE)4-Lux reporter cells (unpublished data). TGF-beta activation was specifically mediated by alphavbeta8, since it was substantially inhibited by the anti-beta8 antibody, 37E1 (Fig. 2, a-c). The other RGD binding integrin heterodimers normally present in SW480, HT1080, and MvLu cells (Table I) did not mediate significant activation of TGF-beta because mock-transduced cells did not activate TGF-beta (Fig. 2, a-c). However, H647 cells, which normally express alphavbeta6 (Table I), activated TGF-beta (note the higher activation in mock H647 cells than in other cell lines in Fig. 2 d). This activation in mock-transduced H647 cells could be completely inhibited by antibodies to beta6; activation in beta8-expressing H647 cells could be completely inhibited by a combination of beta8 and beta6 antibodies (unpublished data). These data demonstrate that when beta8 and beta6 are coexpressed the resulting TGF-beta activation is additive. The TGF-beta isoform that was primarily responsible for TGF-beta activation in our system was TGF-beta1, since TGF-beta1 isoform-specific antibodies inhibited 80-90% of the activation in SW480, HT1080, MvLu, and H647 cells, whereas TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3 isoform-specific antibodies had minimal effect (unpublished data).
