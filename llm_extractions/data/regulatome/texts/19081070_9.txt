Through the analysis of Gli2 and Gli3 mutant mice, an unexpectedly complex and differential utilization of GliA and GliR function in various Hh-dependent processes during embryonic development was uncovered. For example, Shh is a mitogen and promotes cell proliferation in many embryonic and adult tissues. In the embryonic epidermis, GliA function is the principal effector of Shh-dependent cell proliferation and overexpression of Gli1 or Gli2 can induce spontaneous skin tumorigenesis; however, loss of Gli3 function has minimal effects on hair follicle development and is unable to restore cell proliferation in Shh-/- skin. In many other tissues, GliA function is not essential for Shh-dependent cell proliferation and Shh appears to function primarily by preventing Gli3/GliR action (see for example). Interestingly, there is evidence that Gli3R can block Wnt signaling by binding beta-catenin and inhibiting its transcriptional activator activity. This mechanism may account for many contexts, such as the vertebrate neural tube, in which Hh and Wnt signaling promote cell proliferation in a cooperative or interdependent manner. However, a genome-wide in silico study has predicted a large number of mammalian enhancers harboring both Gli and Tcf binding sites, suggesting that shared enhancer elements may also represent a common mechanism integrating Hh and Wnt signaling. Thus, depending on the developmental context, Shh signaling regulates cell proliferation through a variety of mechanisms involving GliA activity or GliR inhibition.
