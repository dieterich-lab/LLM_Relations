In addition, we tested whether JunB-mediated hypertrophy involves the activation and fusion of satellite cells, the muscle stem cells. To test this possibility, we treated mice with BrdU after transfection. 9 d later, we monitored for incorporation of BrdU-positive nuclei into fibers expressing JunB. However, we never detected BrdU in myonuclei of transfected fibers (Fig. S2 A, left). In control experiments, we could confirm efficient incorporation of BrdU into myonuclei in damaged muscles undergoing regeneration (Fig. S2 A, right). Thus, JunB-mediated hypertrophy does not require activation and recruitment of satellite cells. Because contractile proteins comprise >40% of total muscle proteins, we tested whether JunB, while stimulating muscle hypertrophy, affects myosin gene expression. We cotransfected JunB and a promoter reporter construct for fast (myosin heavy chain type 2B [MyHC-2B]) myosin into the glycolytic fast TA muscle. JunB greatly enhanced transcription of the MyHC-2B promoter (Fig. 3 E). This finding is noteworthy because MyHC-2B is the most abundant myosin in TA muscles and is induced during fiber hypertrophy. Furthermore, we observed a similar increase in MyHC-2B mRNA in myotubes overexpressing JunB by adenovirus infection (Fig. 3 F). In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis confirmed the binding of JunB to the MyHC-2B promoter (Fig. 3 G). Thus, JunB promotes hypertrophy by enhancing overall protein synthesis and by activating myosin expression.
