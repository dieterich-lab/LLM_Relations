(A) Western blots show immunoprecipitation of TACC3 from DT40 cell extracts. Cells were blocked in mitosis by nocodazole (+Noc) for 16 hours or released from nocodazole block into MG132 for 1 hour (+MG132). Genotypes are as indicated. Antibodies against TACC3 or random rabbit IgG (Con) were used for immunoprecipitation (IP). Inputs represent cytoplasmic extracts. Blots were probed with anti-TACC3 or anti-phospho-S574-TACC3 (P-TACC3) antibodies. The percentages below the plots refer to P-TACC3 signal levels in the mutants relative to WT. Band intensities were analysed on films with ImageJ; P-TACC3 signal was normalized against total TACC3 (inputs) or total immunoprecipitated TACC3 for each genotype. (B) Western blots show co-immunoprecipitation of clathrin and TACC3 from DT40 cell extracts. Genotypes are as indicated. Antibodies against clathrin heavy chain (CHC) or random rabbit IgG (con) were used for immunoprecipitation (IP). Inputs represent cytoplasmic extracts. Blots were probed with anti-CHC or anti-TACC3 antibodies, as indicated. The percentages below the plots refer to TACC3 signal levels in F543A relative to WT. Band intensities were analysed on films with ImageJ and TACC3 signal was normalized against total immunoprecipitated clathrin for each genotype. (C) Western blots show co-immunoprecipitation of clathrin with P-TACC3 from WT and F543A DT40 cell extracts. Antibodies against clathrin heavy chain (CHC) or random rabbit IgG (con) were used for immunoprecipitation (IP). Inputs represent cytoplasmic extracts. Blots were probed with anti-CHC, anti-TACC3 or anti P-TACC3 antibodies, as indicated. (D) Localisation of clathrin in mitotic cells is shown on left. In merged images alpha-tubulin is green, clathrin (CHC) is red and DNA is blue. Scale bar = 5 mum. Box plot on right depicts mean intensity of clathrin staining on the mitotic spindle. Signal intensity of clathrin (CHC) antibody was quantified in mitotic spindle volumes defined by alpha-tubulin-FITC staining. A minimum of 25 cells was scored per genotype. Statistical significance was assessed using t-test (***P = 0.0001, **** P < 0.0001). (E) Western blots of sucrose gradient centrifugation from WT and F543A cytoplasmic cell extracts. Note different fractionation patterns between genotypes: in F543A cells fraction 13 contains increased amounts of ch-TOG, TACC3 and Aurora-A, but not clathrin. TPX2 and EB1 display similar fractionation patterns between WT and F543A cells. Position of molecular weight markers (BSA: 4.4S; Apoferritin: 17.6S; Thyroglobulin: 19.4S) on the gradient is shown.
