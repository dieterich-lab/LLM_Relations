Based on this initial analysis, enrichment scores for each LEDGF fusion protein were calculated versus random integrations for three target gene classes: Pol II-transcribed snRNAs, replication-dependent histones, and the TSSs of genes with polyadenylated mRNAs. INTS3, NABP1, NABP2, INTS9, and INTS11 all displayed substantial enrichment at these loci, with enrichment values of 20-40 times of the random sample (Figure 1F). INIP did not show a similar degree of enrichment at the histones or poly A TSSs, possibly due to a smaller number of sequence reads. Overall, HIT-Seq analysis demonstrated that INTS3/NABP complexes associate with Integrator at snRNA genes, replication-dependent histones, and a subset of genes that produce polyadenylated messages.
