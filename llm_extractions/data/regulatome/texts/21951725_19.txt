We next addressed the ability of Rab35 and MICAL-L1 to interact in mammalian cells. When HeLa cells were transfected with HAMICAL-L1 along with either wild-type Myc-Rab35 or Myc-Vps45 (negative control) and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, we were able to co-immunoprecipitate Myc-Rab35 but not Myc-Vps45 (Fig. 4A). Since the CC region of the MICAL-L1 paralog, MICAL-L2, interacts with Rab8 and Rab13, we hypothesized that the CC region of MICAL-L1 (Fig. 4B) might interact with Rab35. Indeed, the CC region of MICAL-L1 is sufficient for an interaction with the wild-type and dominant-active mutants of Rab35 (and Rab10), but not with the dominant-negative mutants of Rab35 and Rab10 (Fig. 4C).
