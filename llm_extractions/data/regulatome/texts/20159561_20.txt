Previous studies have provided evidence for links among different MLL translocation partners. ENL, AF9 and AF10 have been linked to the histone methyltransferase Dot1; and it was suggested that a common mechanism of MLL-translocation-based leukemia was through H3K79 methylation by Dot1. However, the most common translocation partner of MLL is AFF1, which our present studies show does not associate with Dot1. Other studies suggesting a physical interaction between Dot1 and AFF1 were based on the isolation of these two proteins in ENL immunoprecipitates and through building a network of 2-hybrid and other interactions. However, we have determined the proteins associated with some of the commonly occurring MLL chimeras found in infant leukemias. MLL-AFF1 does not physically associate with Dot1, so a role for Dot1 at genes upregulated in MLL-AFF1 leukemias may be subsequent to gene activation by this MLL chimera. We have recently shown that Dot1-mediated H3K79 methylation is linked to cell cycle control in yeast and methylation by Dot1 could also have some role in transcriptional enhancement in leukemogenesis. In contrast, MLL-AFF1 co-purified the SEC complex containing ELL1 and P-TEFb, two proven transcription elongation factors in vitro and in vivo, each with demonstrated abilities to activate transcription through transcription elongation. It will be interesting and essential to further determine the mechanisms and regulation of the SEC complex in transcriptional control in normal development and leukemogenesis. Both AFF1 and AFF4 copurify with the ELL proteins and another AFF protein, AFF3, which is also a rare translocation partner with MLL. The related AFF2 gene (FMR2) is silenced in a form of mental retardation, thus implicating all members of this family in human diseases. P-TEFb itself is involved in a number of malignancies and developmental diseases, and it will be intriguing to determine which of these processes involve SEC or SEC-like complexes.
