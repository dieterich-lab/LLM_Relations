Using the FF483-484AA FF531-532AA double mutant of Poleta constructed in this study, Akagi et al. (J. Akagi, C. Masutani, K. Kataoka, T. Kan, E. O., T. Mori, H. O., and F. Hanaoka, submitted for publication) showed that the mutant Poleta protein was defective for the interaction with REV1 in cultured human cells, while it exhibits normal enzyme activity when assayed in the crude lysate with a T-T CPD containing template DNA. In contrast with Polkappa FF567-568AA (which did not complement the BPDE-sensitivity of Polk-/- cells), the REV1 interaction-deficient mutant of Poleta corrected the UV-sensitivity of XPV cells as efficiently as wild-type Poleta. Furthermore, upon UV-irradiation re-localization of endogenous REV1 required its interaction with Poleta, while the re-localization of Poleta occurred independently of REV1. These results suggest that Poleta is recruited to sites of UV-induced DNA damage before REV1.
