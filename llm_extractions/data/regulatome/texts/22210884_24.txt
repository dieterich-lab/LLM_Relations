The mode of action of Lin28 in translation has been suggested: Lin28 binds to target mRNAs through recognition of LREs and subsequently recruits RNA helicase A (RHA) that plays an important role in facilitating RNP rearrangement during translation, thereby stimulating translation. To confirm a direct interaction between Lin28 and the 95-nt LRE (Oct4-95), we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) with the Oct4-95 RNA and recombinant Lin28 protein (rLin28), using pre-let-7a RNA as a positive control. Figure 1 shows autoradiographs of non-denaturing gel electrophoresis of 32P-labeled Oct4-95 RNA (Figure 1A) or pre-let-7a RNA (Figure 1B) with increasing concentrations of rLin28. While only one protein-RNA complex (Complex 1, Figure 1B) formed with pre-let-7a, two complexes (Complex 1 and 2, Figure 1A) formed with Oct4-95 RNA, with Complex 2 forming at higher rLin28 concentrations, suggesting that more than one molecules of Lin28 may bind Oct4-95 at higher concentrations. To simplify the analysis, we combined Complex 1 and 2 as one complex in our Kd calculation. Thus, we estimated the Kd of Lin28 binding to the Oct4-95 RNA to be 1.13 microM (Figure 1A, bottom panel), and to the pre-let-7a to be 1.99 microM (Figure 1B, bottom panel). The slightly lower Kd value for Oct4-95 compared to pre-let-7 (which was reported to be 2.1 microM) was also reflected by competition experiments showing that unlabeled Oct4-95 competed better for binding to Lin28 than the unlabeled pre-let-7a RNA (Figure 1C). Based on these findings we conclude that Lin28 binds Oct4-95 RNA directly and with an affinity similar to that of pre-let-7a RNA.
