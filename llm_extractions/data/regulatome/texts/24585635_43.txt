In contrast to the well-studied ERK1 and ERK2, much less is known about ERK3 in regard to the molecular regulation of its signaling (both expression and activation). Although it has been shown that the ERK3 knockout mice display neonatal lethality mainly due to pulmonary immaturity, the functions of ERK3 in specific tissues and physiological processes are still largely unknown. In the current study we found that ERK3 gene expression is regulated by cytokines through c-Jun transcription factor and we revealed a previously unknown function for ERK3 in regulating endothelial cell migration, proliferation and angiogenesis. It is worth noting that cytokines induce ERK3 expression not only in endothelial cells but also in macrophages and cancer cells (data not shown), suggesting the regulation of ERK3 by cytokines is probably a general event in mammalian cells. While both IKKs/NFkappaB and MAPK/AP-1 are the major signaling pathways that are activated by cytokine signals, the induction of ERK3 expression by TNFalpha is mainly regulated by AP-1-mediated transcription. Interestingly, we found that c-Jun, but not c-Fos, is required for this regulation, demonstrating another level of regulatory specificity in cytokine-induced ERK3 gene expression. In line with c-Jun's function as an angiogenesis-promoting factor, ERK3, as a c-Jun target, also plays an important role in endothelial cell function including in vitro angiogenesis. To our knowledge, our study is the first revealing a molecular regulatory mechanism of ERK3 gene transcription in response to extracellular signals. In addition, it is of note that while ERK1/2 signaling is highly regulated by growth factors such as EGF, neither activation nor expression of ERK3 (Fig. 1B) is affected by this growth factor.
