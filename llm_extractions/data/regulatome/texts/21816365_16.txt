As levels of Bra expression in the mouse primitive streak have been shown to influence cell recruitment and their phenotype, we hypothesized that 36 hr FLyA and FLyB treatments would induce broadly different gene expression profiles. The heat map of predominantly up- or downregulated genes confirmed that characteristic endoderm-associated genes were upregulated in FLyA and downregulated or absent in FLyB (Figure 2B). Conversely, of numerous genes that were upregulated in FLyB and downregulated or absent in FLyA, many were explicitly mesodermal (e.g., ISL1, TBX6, LMO2) and some were trophoblast associated (e.g., HAND1, CDX2). Other genes were upregulated in both conditions (e.g., BRA, MIXL1, MESP1, EOMES), suggesting that they distinguish a mesendodermal population. To extend these results, we investigated the protein expression of HAND1, MESP1, and FOXA2 in FLyB and FLyA conditions (Figure 2C; Figures S2D and S2E). Flow cytometry analysis showed that, as suggested by the transcriptional profiles, HAND1 and FOXA2 expression were only observed in BMP or in Activin, respectively. As before, both treatments induced a high proportion of BRA-expressing cells (approximately 80%-90%). HAND1 expression in response to FLyB mainly colocalized with BRA in BRAhigh cells and also colocalized with CDX2 (65% of HAND1+ cells). By contrast, FOXA2 expression in response to FLyA mainly colocalized with BRA in BRAlow cells and with SOX17 (65% of FOXA2+ cells). As expected from their transcriptional profiles, both FLyB- and FLyA-treated hESCs expressed MESP1, which colocalized with BRA in both BRAhigh and BRAlow cells. Taken together, these results confirmed that mesoderm and endoderm emerged as two distinct populations in response to treatment with BMP + FGF or Activin + FGF, respectively.
