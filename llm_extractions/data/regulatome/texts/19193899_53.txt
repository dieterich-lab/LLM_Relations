To demonstrate that SRF functionally links stimulation to SRE1-mediated Arc expression, we tested whether SRF itself is regulated by synaptic activity or BDNF. Both significantly induced an SRE-driven firefly luciferase reporter gene (SRE-Luciferase) that directly measures SRF activity (Fig. 5E). Synaptic activity also led to the phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 5F), a kinase that activates SRF-containing promoter complexes and SRE-dependent gene transcription and is required for Arc induction. These data show that SRF mediates transcription in response to patterns of synaptic activity or BDNF stimulation that induce endogenous Arc expression (Fig. 1B).
