This suggests that Rab3GEP plays a role in melanosome transport and functions in the same pathway as Rab27a/Mlph/myosin Va. A putative role for Rab3GEP as a GEF for Rab27a in melanocytes would be consistent with these results. Furthermore, our data suggest that Rab3GEP activity is not redundant in melanocytes.
