Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, interact with the pore-forming proteins Bax and Bak preventing their induction of MOMP and ultimately apoptosis. After induction of both Bcl-2 and STAT3 with phospholipase D in HeLa cells, the Bcl-2 gene was found to contain STAT3 binding sites. STAT3 was found to directly associate with the Bcl-2 gene promoter and up regulate Bcl-2 expression thereby suppressing apoptosis in these cells. Binding sites for STAT3 were also found in the gene promoter for Mcl-1 and inhibition of STAT3 resulted in decreased Mcl-1 levels in peripheral leukocytes. EMSA experiments later showed that STAT3 can directly bind these STAT3 elements within the MCL1 promoter and drive gene activation in LGL leukemia cells. Another anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xL, was also seen to be up regulated with STAT3 expression. Serial truncation of the Bcl-xL gene promoter revealed the proximal region of the promoter was required for STAT3-induced activation of the Bcl-xL gene but direct binding was not assessed.
