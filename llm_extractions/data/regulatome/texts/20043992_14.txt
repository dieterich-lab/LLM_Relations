Virus-induced phosphoactivation of IRFs, thought to be mediated directly or indirectly by IKKepsilon and/or TBK1, occurs in the C-terminal region of IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7 at Ser/Thr residues. There are different sites of Ser/Thr residues in the C-terminal region of IRFs which may play different roles in its phosphorylation. For instance, the phosphorylation of serine 396 was first observed in a study with a phosphorylation-specific antibody. Mori and his group identified phosphorylation of serine 386 as the critical determinant for the activation of IRF-3. IRF-3 has two phosphorylation sites: site 1 includes Ser385 and Ser386, whereas site 2 includes Ser 396, Ser 398, Ser 402, Thr 404 and Ser 405 within the C-terminal region. Moreover, biochemical and calorimetric evidence from Chen and colleagues revealed that serine 386 and serine 396 play critical and complementary functions in IRF-3 phosphorylation. Phosphomimetic mutation of these Ser/Thr residues to Asp reduces autoinhibition. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that phosphorylating residues in site 2 alleviates autoinhibition and allows IRF-3 to interact with CBP/p300. However, a recent study demonstrated that phosphorylation of IRF-3 on Ser 339 is another important covalent modification involved in this process to generate a hyperactive form of IRF-3. Since phosphorylation of Ser 396 precedes the phosphorylation of Ser 339, the authors propose that phosphorylation of Ser 339 is another important covalent modification involved in IRF-3 activation.
