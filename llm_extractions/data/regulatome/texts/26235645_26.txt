In contrast to the results obtained with mouse liver, the anti-Otulin antibody recognized a ~43-kDa double band that co-elutes with the HA-UbVME-insensitive activity (Fig. 5b, lower panel, fractions 10-11). The reason for the two bands is unknown, but they do correspond to Otulin, as determined by siRNA knockdown experiments (Fig. 5d). None of the anti-Otulin antibodies tested immunoprecipitates the enzyme. Thus, total extracts from control and OTULIN knocked-down HeLa cells were prepared and assayed for UBB-processing activity. As shown in Fig. 5e, extracts from the OTULIN knocked-down cells present almost no HA-UbVME-insensitive activity (compare lanes 2 and 5, respectively). Together, these results strongly suggest that USP5 and Otulin are by far the most active DUBs acting on polyUbs.
