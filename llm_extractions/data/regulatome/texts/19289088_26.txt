Data have been presented showing two significant differences between mesenchymal and epithelial cultures. First, although TGF-beta activates PAK2 in fibroblasts, this does not occur in epithelia; and second, the epithelial enriched protein Erbin has a critical role in regulating this cell type difference (Figures 2-5). These findings generate the following question, would Erbin loss be sufficient for epithelial cells to activate PAK2? To address that issue, human A549 cells were generated stably expressing siRNA against Erbin. Knockdown of Erbin had no effect on basal or TGF-beta stimulated PAK2 activity, Cdc42 activation, Cdc42 binding PAK2, or morphologic changes (Figures 6A and 6B). Since A549 cells do not activate the upstream components (i.e., Rho proteins) necessary for PAK2 activation, it was not unexpected that Erbin loss would be ineffective in inducing PAK2 kinase activity.
