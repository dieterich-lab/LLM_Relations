To separate the relative contribution of caspase-11 versus GSDMD inhibition on pore formation, we first examined liposome leakage by pre-cleaved GSDMD. Disulfiram inhibited liposome leakage by pre-cleaved GSDMD with an IC50 of 0.26 +/- 0.01 muM (Fig. 3a) that was comparable to its IC50 of 0.30 +/- 0.01 muM for inhibiting full-length GSDMD plus caspase-11 (Fig. 1e). Disulfiram did not inhibit pore formation of pre-cleaved GSDMA3, suggesting that disulfiram does not inhibit the entire GSDM family (Fig. 3b). We then performed a time course of liposome leakage (Fig. 3c) and GSDMD cleavage by caspase-11 (Fig. 3d) in the presence or absence of disulfiram (50 muM). GSDMD processing by caspase-11 was unaffected by disulfiram, but processed GSDMD-NT did not cause liposome leakage if disulfiram was present. These data demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of disulfiram in the liposome leakage assay is mainly mediated by direct inhibition of GSDMD pore formation, rather than inhibition of caspase-11.
