A previous study addressing the function of ICT1 used a heterologous combination of E. coli 70S ribosomes and human mitochondrial ICT1. In the present study, we employed homologous systems in most experiments: 55S mitochondrial ribosomes and purified mitochondrial factors including human mitochondrial ICT1. Our analyses revealed that exogenous ICT1 functions independently of the 55S-integrated ICT1; the 55S-integrated ICT1 shows no peptide-release activity. This is in agreement with a recent cryo-EM analysis at 4.9 Aa resolution of the large subunit of porcine mitochondrial ribosomes, according to which ICT1 is located at the base of the central protuberance >70 Aa away from the A site. A conformational change of the large ribosomal subunit bringing the integrated ICT1 to the A-site is hardly conceivable.
