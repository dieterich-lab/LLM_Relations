The current model for Hrs UIM function is that the Hrs UIM binds ubiquitinated membrane cargo proteins at early endosomes, thereby facilitating the sorting of these proteins to the lysosomal pathway. In support of this model, we identified 9 known and 3 novel membrane proteins as Hrs UIM-interacting proteins (Table 1), which likely represent endosomal cargo proteins that undergo ubiquitination-dependent sorting by Hrs. Among the Hrs UIM-interacting membrane proteins, we identified amyloid beta A4 protein (APP) and the related APP-like protein 2 (APLP2). Mutations in the APP gene are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that APP localizes to endosomes and that APP is ubiquitinated. Our finding that the Hrs UIM binds to APP is of particular interest given the increasing evidence that endosomal abnormalities, specifically enlarged early endosomes, precede the appearance of symptoms in AD. Our study provides the first report of an interaction between a component of the endosomal sorting machinery and APP and suggests an aberrant Hrs-mediated endosomal sorting of APP may be involved in AD pathogenesis.
