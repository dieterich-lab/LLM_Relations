The two colon cancer cell lines primarily utilized in this study were SW480 and COLO205 cells, which both express low levels of endogenous SOCS3. SW480 cells were used for the majority of studies because our prior studies demonstrated that these cells are responsive to both IL-6 and TNFalpha, which robustly activate STAT3 and NFkappaB, respectively. COLO205 cells were used as an independent cell line to confirm cytokine-induction of TNFR2. Since COLO205 cells grow well in soft agar they were also used to address effects of TNFR2 and SOCS3 on anchorage-independent growth. SW480, COLO205, and Caco2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The human intestinal epithelial cell line (HIECs) were generously provided by Dr. Jean-Francois Beaulieu (University of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50U/mL penicillin, and 50mg/mL streptomycin. Given prior findings that both IL-6 and TNFalpha were required to induce TNFR2, cells were treated with recombinant human IL-6 and/or TNFalpha (Peprotech) at 50ng/mL in serum-free medium. Cells were harvested at various times after cytokine treatment for evaluation of TNFR2 mRNA and protein, or STAT3 and NFkappaB binding to consensus regions in the TNFR2 promoter.
