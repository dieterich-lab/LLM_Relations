The mammalian cochlea separates acoustic frequencies along its length so that auditory nerve fibers emanating from different regions are tuned to disparate frequencies, responding preferentially to high pitched tones at the base and low pitched ones at the apex. This systematic change in best frequency along the length of the cochlea, referred to as the tonotopic organization, stems from gradients in numerous properties including the dimensions of the cochlear partition and the ion channel complement of the outer hair cells (OHCs). Among these variables is the single-channel conductance of the MT channel, which, in mammals, increases from apex to base in OHCs but remains constant in inner hair cells (IHCs). This suggests that multiple isoforms of the MT channel protein may be differentially distributed along the mammalian cochlea. Here, we characterized MT channel properties in both wild-type mice and Tmc mutants and found that, in the first postnatal week, there is also a tonotopic gradient in the Ca2+ selectivity of the OHC MT channel that can be modified by mutations in Tmc1 or Tmc2. Our results suggest that the Tmc proteins specify the subunit composition of the MT channel.
