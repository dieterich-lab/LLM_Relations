The importance of atRA degradation to controlling atRA function has been illustrated by knockout of CYP26A1, the only atRA-dedicated CYP knocked out to date. CYP26A1-null mice die during mid to late gestation with morphological defects that involve the hindbrain, vertebrae, and tailbud. The mutants have spina bifida, tail truncation, and kidney abnormalities, among other deformities, which mimic those produced by treating WT mice with excess atRA. These outcomes contribute to the insight that concentrations of atRA must be tightly controlled spatially and temporarily during development. Whereas developing embryos require atRA, they also require it in measured amounts and/or not at all in some loci, consistent with the well-known teratogenicity of atRA, or of retinol given in sufficiently high doses to defeat control mechanisms and produce atRA pharmacologically. Interestingly, crossing CYP26A1-null mice with RALDH2-null mice (heterozygotes) results in 12 of the 17 offspring living until weaning. These data indicate that oxidized derivatives of atRA, such as 4-oxo-RA, 4-OH-RA, and 18-OH-RA, represent catabolites of atRA, and by preventing atRA catabolism, a reduction in atRA generation can be made tolerable. This is the same phenomenon observed in the RDH1-null mice, which have diminished CYP26A1 expression, and illustrates the principle underlying the efficacy of RAMBA.
