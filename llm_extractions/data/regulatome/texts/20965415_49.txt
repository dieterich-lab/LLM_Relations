Bulky DNA lesions can lead to arrest of leading strand synthesis at the replication fork and formation of extensive RPA-coated ssDNA regions due to the uncoupling between the MCM helicase and the DNA polymerase (Figure 1B). RPA1 polymerizes on this ssDNA to generate a platform that activates the central signaling pathway orchestrating DNA replication responses, the ATR pathway. RPA-ssDNA complexes recruits the ATR/ATRIP complex through direct interaction with ATRIP to localize it to the fork (Figure 1B). Furthermore, it stimulates binding and activation of the RAD17-RFC2-5 clamp loader, which loads the PCNA-related RAD9-HUS1-RAD1 (9-1-1) heterotrimer bound to the ATR-activating TOPBP1 protein, and stimulates ATR kinase activity. The 9-1-1 complex is loaded onto 5'- or 3'-DNA ends adjacent to RPA-coated ssDNA regions. It is the colocalization of these two RPA-dependent complexes that sets in motion the ATR signaling cascade, which results in the activation of CHK1 and CHK2 kinase signaling and phosphorylation of many chromatin bound factors to promote fork stability and restart of stalled or collapsed replication forks in order to complete chromosome replication.
