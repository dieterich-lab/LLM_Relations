Rag GTPases were shown to be present on the lysosomal membrane. Thus, we were interested in subcellular localization of Sestrin2. Interestingly, Sestrin2 was almost completely excluded from lysosomal membrane (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the strong physical association between Sestrin2 and GATOR2 (Fig. 1), WDR24, a GATOR2 component, showed substantial co-localization with Sestrin2 (Fig. 4D), while also excluded from lysosomal membrane (Fig. 4E). Because GATOR1 was reported to be present on the lysosomal membrane when overexpressed, and because Sestrin2 indirectly regulates the association between GATOR1 and RagB, it is possible that Sestrin2 changes the subcellular localization of GATOR1 through displacement of GATOR2. Indeed, although endogenous DEPDC5, a GATOR1 component, does not show significant lysosomal localization under normal culture conditions, a substantial amount of DEPDC5 accumulated on the lysosomal membrane when Sestrin2 was overexpressed (Fig. 4F, arrows). Overexpressed Sestrin2 itself was not co-localized with lysosomally-accumulated DEPDC5 (Fig. 4G). These results collectively indicate that Sestrin2 indirectly regulates RagB-mTORC1 signaling by modulating GATOR complexes.
