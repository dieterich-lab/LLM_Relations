The Tet family proteins include three members Tet1-3 (Fig. S1a). In addition to the dioxygenase motif involved in Fe(II) and alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) binding, they also share a conserved cysteine-rich region (Fig. S1a, indicated by D and C, respectively). Recent demonstration that the human Tet1 can convert 5mC to 5hmC in an Fe(II) and alpha-KG-dependent manner prompted us to evaluate whether mouse Tet1 and its homologs possess a similar enzymatic activity. Results shown in Fig. S2 demonstrate that overexpression of both mouse Tet1 and Tet2 catalytic domains greatly reduced 5mC staining in both U2OS and HEK293T cells. In contrast, overexpression of mouse Tet3 catalytic domain in these cells has no apparent effect on 5mC staining. The reduced 5mC staining is not due to blocked access of the antibody by the overexpressed proteins as overexpression of a mutant Tet1 or Tet2 does not affect 5mC staining (Fig. S2a). These results suggest that the enzymatic activity of Tet1 is conserved from human to mouse and that both mouse Tet1 and Tet2 can reduce global 5mC levels when overexpressed in a manner that requires the presence of an intact Fe(II) binding site.
