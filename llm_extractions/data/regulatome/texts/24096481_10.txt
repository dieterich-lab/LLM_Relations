Among a number of reported p53-repressed genes, we included survivin, CDC25C, and CDC25B in our analysis based on their strong transcriptional repression in our microarray analysis of p53-induced expression changes and published studies implicating them as direct p53 transcriptional targets with key roles in cell-cycle progression and apoptosis. As expected, the expression levels of each of these p53-repression targets decreased in HCT116 WT cells in response to both doxorubicin and nutlin-3 treatments, but not in HCT116 p53-/- cells (Figure 1c). However, this repression did not occur in HCT116 p21-/- cells (Figure 1c). These results indicated that the presence and/or activation of p21 were likely required for p53 to repress these target genes.
