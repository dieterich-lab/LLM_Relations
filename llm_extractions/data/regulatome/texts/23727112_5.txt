In addition to its productive effect on CSR, 53BP1 blocks DNA ends from resection in BRCA1-deficient cells, leading to toxic radial chromosomes that arise from NHEJ. Deletion of 53BP1 leads to deposition of HR factors RPA and RAD51 on single strand DNA, which, in the case of recombining switch regions, promotes intra-switch recombination, and in the setting of BRCA1-deficiency, restores HR. Thus, DNA end protection by 53BP1 is critical for CSR in G1 but can unleash genome instability in S phase.
