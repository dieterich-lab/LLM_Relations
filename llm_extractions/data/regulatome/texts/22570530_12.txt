Sugar binding specificity was examined using recombinant hCL-L1 CRDs produced in E. coli. Two recombinant hCL-L1 CRD fusion proteins, hCL-L1 CRD-histidine tag fusion protein (hCL-L1-CRDhis) and hCL-L1 CRD-maltose binding fusion protein (hCL-L1-CRDmal), were established. Sugar-blot analyses demonstrated that the two recombinant hCL-L1 CRDs possess Ca++-dependent binding activity towards mannose. ELISA analyses using same sugar probes indicated that hCL-L1 has the ability to bind to D-mannose, L-fucose, and D-galactose > N-acetylglucosamine >> N-acetylgalactosamine. Kawai and our group reported that the recombinant mCL-L1 CRD exhibited properties similar to recombinant hCL-L1. Sugar-blot analyses demonstrated that CL-K1 has the ability to bind to L-fucose, weakly to D-mannose, but it could not bind to N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, or D-glucose. We observed that CL-K1 Ca++ dependently bound to L-fucose-agarose, weakly to mannan-agarose and N-acetylglucosamine-agarose, but not at all to maltose-agarose or N-acetylgalactosamine-agarose. Unexpectedly, MBL could bind maltose-agarose and L-fucose-agarose, and bound even more strongly to mannan-agarose and N-acetylglucosamine-agarose. Monosaccharide inhibition of CL-K1 binding to mannose-conjugated BSA was strongest with L-fucose and D-mannose followed by D-glucose and weakest by N-acetylglucosamine and D-galactose. The five amino acid residues of the CRD, namely, the lectin frame, are responsible for its association with calcium ions in the binding of carbohydrates. The two amino acid residues in the CRD of CL-K1 are Glu232 and Asn234 (Glu-Pro-Asn) as in that of MBL. The lectin frame further supports its binding specificity for D-mannose, D-glucose, L-fucose and N-acetylglucosamine. However, CL-K1 binds strongly to L-fucose, but hardly to N-acetylglucosamine. We found that the four cysteines and other 14 amino acid residues, including Glu and Asn of CRD, were conserved among the three classical collectins. The cysteines in the CRD are not for oligomerization, which is through those at the N-terminal of the collagen domain in MBL. However, the basic frame of MBL had two amino acid residues, Tyr231 and Asn233, which were substituted by Phe225 and Lys227 in the case of CL-K1. These substitutions might change the ability of the latter to bind to the N-acetylglucosamine.
