The structural determinants of substrate binding and the enzyme mechanism of CAOs have been examined by the determination of the structures of inhibitor complexes of many of the enzymes. Some of these inhibitors, such as 2-hydrazinopyridine and benzylhydrazine, act as non-hydrolyzable substrate analogues and bind covalently to the TPQ cofactor mimicking the formation of the Schiff base intermediate ( ). Others are mechanism-based inhibitors that were designed to be attacked by the active-site base. The structures of complexes of MOBA (4-(4-methylphenoxy)-2-butyn-1-amine) and NOBA (4-(2-naphthyloxy)-2-butyn-1-amine) of Arthrobacter globiformis amine oxidase AGAO, showed surprisingly that they first acted as substrates and subsequently that the aldehyde products were attacked by the amino quinol of the reduced enzyme to form a covalent adduct. Other inhibitors, such as molecular wires originally designed to probe electron-transfer to the TPQ, bind non-covalently in the active site channel of AGAO. Clonidine binds to a hydrophobic pocket in bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO) close to the TPQ that is consequently forced into its on-Cu inactive conformation. Berenil [1, 3-bis(4'-amidinophenyl)triazene, (BRN)] and pentamidine [1,5-bis(4-amidinophenoxy)pentane, (PNT)] are diamine derivatives that act as drugs used to treat Trypanosomiasis and Pneumocystis pneumonia infections by binding in the minor groove of DNA. Each of the two compounds each has an amidophenyl moiety at either end and they differ only in the length and chemical nature of the central linkers. We have shown that both compounds are excellent inhibitors of hDAO.
