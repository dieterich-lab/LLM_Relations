An emerging area is non-receptor and nucleotide exchange-independent mechanisms for G protein activation. Some of these mechanisms involve binding of proteins to Galpha subunits leading to release of free Gbetagamma subunits, but other proteins and peptides have been recently found that activate G protein betagamma subunit signaling through direct binding to Gbetagamma. Since Gbetagamma is not thought to undergo conformational changes that could lead to nucleotide exchange on Galpha or result in subunit dissociation, the mechanisms for action of these molecules that bind directly to Gbetagamma are not obvious. In most cases, detailed studies of these mechanism have not been done, but some examples are discussed that shed new light on potential roles of Gbetagamma in G protein activation are discussed below.
