The p14ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway is subject to p53 dependent feed-back regulation and resembles a molecular oscillator. MDM2 gene transcription is activated by p53 as a normal part of the mechanisms that resolves a p53 dependent growth arrest in response to DNA damage or oncogenic stimuli. The linkage of this pathway to RUNX3 indicates that p53 can indirectly control RUNX3 levels. In conclusion, our results suggest involvement of RUNX3 in oncogene surveillance and a remarkable dual role for MDM2 in attenuating the levels of p53 and RUNX3 as principal tumor suppressors.
