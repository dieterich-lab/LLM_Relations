Knockdown of endogenous NF-Yalpha by siRNA inhibits LKB1 expression in "444", C33a and IMR-90 cells. Cells were transfected either with scrambled siRNA (Ctr) or with a siRNA targeting NF-Yalpha (NF-YA). Total RNA was purified and mRNA levels of NF-YA, NF-YB, LKB1 and GAPDH were analysed by RT-PCR using ethidium bromide staining (A). Equal amounts of total protein (5 microg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by western blotting using antibodies against LKB1, phospho-AMPK (Thr172) and actin (B). The data shown is representative of three independent experiments.
