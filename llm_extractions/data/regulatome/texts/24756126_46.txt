Earlier reports have supported a contribution of chaperones to the biology of Stat3. Stat3 previously was identified within the cytosol of unstimulated cells (HepG3), predominantly within high-molecular weight complexes in the size range of 200-400 kDa (Statosome I) and 1-2 MDa (Statosome II). Antibody-subtracted differential protein display using anti-Stat3 antibody identified the chaperone GRP58/ER-60/ERp57 as a major component, along with Stat3, of Statosome I. The composition of Statosome II was not determined; however, it is of interest, in light of our current findings, that its size is consistent with that of TRiC. Stat3 was demonstrated to directly interact with Hsp90, and its activation was linked to Hsp90 following IL-6 stimulation. In addition, inhibition of Hsp90 using pharmacological inhibitors (17-DMAG) or siRNA decreased levels of pStat3 in human primary hepatocytes and levels of total Stat3 in multiple myeloma cells.
