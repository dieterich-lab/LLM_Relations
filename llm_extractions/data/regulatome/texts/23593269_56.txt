The data regarding the role of Fyn in cytokine production and Th2 cell differentiation is somewhat conflicting. While some have reported that Fyn KO mice have impaired IL-4 production, others demonstrated that Fyn KO T cells preferentially differentiate into Th2 cells. Consistent with these findings, Fyn KO mice showed exacerbated responses in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. In fact, it is possible that Fyn is involved in the secretion of both IL-4 and IFN-gamma. These cytokines promote the production of different Ig isotypes, so the question of which cytokine is more impaired might depend on the physiological context. While IL-4 promotes IgG1 and IgE class switching, IFN-gamma induces IgG2a production. Of note, IgG2c is thought to be controlled in a similar fashion to IgG2a. Here we demonstrate that Fyn-KO mice have dramatically reduced basal and antigen-specific IgG2c levels, consistent with IFN-gamma production being impaired in Fyn-KO mice. In addition to contributing to the regulation of IL-4 in T cells, our results suggest that Fyn also regulates antibody production in a B cell-intrinsic manner, as Fyn-deficient B cells showed defective antibody production following in vitro stimulation.
