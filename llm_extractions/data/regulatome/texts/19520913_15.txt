Since Idol was not subject to strong LXR regulation in liver, we employed an alternative strategy to test its function in this tissue. We infected mice with adenoviral vectors encoding beta-galactosidase or mouse Idol. Idol expression increased plasma levels of total and unesterified cholesterol, whereas levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids and glucose were not significantly altered (Fig. 5C and S7A). Fractionation of plasma lipoproteins revealed that Idol expression caused a phenotype reminiscent of that exhibited by Ldlr(-/-) mice, with the appearance of a prominent LDL peak not present in the control mice (Fig. 5D and S7B). Plasma apoB protein levels were approximately 3-fold increased in in Idol-transduced mice and there was no difference in PCSK9 levels (Fig. S7C,D). Consistent with our in vitro results, hepatic expression of LXR and SREBP-2 target genes was not affected by Idol expression (Fig. S7E), but LDLR protein levels were markedly reduced (Fig. 5E). In contrast, transferrin receptor levels were not altered by Idol. Finally, Idol adenovirus had no effect on plasma cholesterol levels (Fig. S8A) or lipoprotein profiles (Fig. S8B) in Ldlr(-/-) mice, demonstrating that Idol requires LDLR expression for these effects.
