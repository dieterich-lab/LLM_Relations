To analyze whether mutation of Ser454 abolishes cleavage of Scc1 at Arg450 also when Scc1 is part of cohesin complexes that have been loaded onto chromatin in vivo, we incubated chromatin from HeLa cells expressing wild-type Scc1, Scc1-S454A, or Scc1-9xA in Xenopus egg extracts. In this assay, Scc1 is cleaved by separase at Arg172 and Arg450 if the Xenopus egg extract is in a mitotic state, presumably because separase and Plx1 are active under these conditions. Whereas wild-type Scc1 was efficiently cleaved at both sites in mitotic egg extract, we did not observe any fragment resulting from cleavage at Arg450 when either Scc1-S454A or Scc1-9xA was analyzed (Figure 2C and unpublished data), further supporting the conclusion that phosphorylation at Ser454 of Scc1 is essential for cleavage at Arg450.
