Nonetheless, multiple functional studies involving amino acids in this region of the protein show that it seems to be critical for the regulation of MEK1 activity. For example, in the study that originally identified the Q56P mutation, MEK1Q56P-glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins were ~170-fold more active than the wild-type counterparts in terms of their ability to phosphorylate recombinant ERK in vitro. In a separate study, deletion of a predicted alpha-helix encompassing residues 32 to 51 resulted in a mutant (DeltaN3) with basal activity 45 times greater than that of the wild-type enzyme. Similarly, the K57N substitution, shown here, and the D67N substitution both lead to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway in vitro.
