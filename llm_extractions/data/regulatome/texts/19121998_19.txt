Activation of Aurora A by TPX2 is required for full accumulation andphosphorylation of p53. Immature oocytes were injected with controlmorpholinos (left) or morpholinos against TPX2 (right) andthen stimulated to mature by the addition of progesterone. Expression andelectrophoretic behavior of the indicated proteins were checked by Westernblot with the indicated antibodies before (Pro I) or after (Meta II)maturation. Actin was monitored as a loading control. Hatch marks onthe left indicate phosphorylated and dephoshorylated forms of theproteins. For the phospho-Thr-295 blot, the asterisk denotes anonspecific band detected by the Cell Signaling antibody.
