Intracellular assembly of VLDL: two major steps in separate cell compartments.  The assembly of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) occurs in two major steps. The first step is the co-and post-translational lipidation of apoB, forming pre-VLDL in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein catalyzes this step. In the second step pre-VLDL is converted to bona fide VLDL in a smooth membrane compartment. This step depends on ADP-ribosylation factor 1 and its activation of phospholipase D.
