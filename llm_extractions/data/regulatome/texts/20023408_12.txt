How can the seemingly contradictory evidence for initiation of NMD by decapping and deadenylation versus endonucleolytic cleavage in human cells be reconciled? The simplest hypothesis is that after PTC recognition, a transcript can be subjected to either degradation route: it is either degraded through the "normal" mRNA turnover pathway starting with deadenylation and/or decapping or through endonucleolytic cleavage. In either case, this is followed by exonucleolytic decay of the resulting RNA fragments from the unprotected ends (Fig. 1). If so, what determines which pathway is activated? Interestingly, SMG5, SMG6 and SMG7 are all proteins of similar structure that, at least in part, interact through 14-3-3-like domains with the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of UPF1. However, whereas the PIN domain of SMG6 possesses endonuclease activity, the PIN domain of SMG5 lacks important catalytic residues and SMG7 has no PIN domain at all. SMG7 on the other hand activates mRNA decay in a DCP2- and XRN1-dependent manner, but independently of SMG6, when tethered to a reporter mRNA. Is it possible that the identity of the SMG5-7 protein(s) recruited to the NMD complex determines the mechanism of decay? This idea may explain why in flies, which lack a paralog of SMG7, NMD appears to rely on SMG6-mediated endocleavage, whereas in yeast, which lack SMG6 but possess Ebs1p, a protein homologous to SMG7, NMD initiates by decapping and deadenylation.
