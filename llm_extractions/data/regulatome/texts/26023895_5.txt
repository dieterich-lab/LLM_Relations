FIX plays a key role in maintaining normal hemostasis and its deficiency is associated with mild to severe bleeding in hemophilia B patients. FIX deficiency is inherited as an X-linked recessive disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 25,000 in newborn males worldwide. It is caused by a wide range of mutations that can include point mutations (nonsense and missense), insertions, deletions and other complex rearrangements of the FIX gene. The mutations are distributed through the entire FIX gene, encoding different domains of the protein. More than 1000 FIX gene mutations causing FIX deficiency, most of which are located on the catalytic domain, have thus far been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database. FIX deficiency causes a defect in the intrinsic pathway and based on the clotting activity, it can be classified as severe (<1%), moderate (1-5%) and mild (5-30%). In a recent study aimed at elucidating the spectrum of FIX gene mutations in Chinese hemophilia B patients, we identified two missense mutations resulting in substitution of Gly-317 (Gly-149 in chymotrypsin numbering) with an Arg (G317R) in one patient and with a Glu (G317E) in the other. The Arg mutation in the first patient caused severe bleeding, however, the Glu substitution resulted in moderate bleeding in the second patient. To understand the molecular basis for different clinical manifestation of Gly-317 mutations in these patients, we expressed wild-type and the two different mutants of FIX in mammalian cells, purified to homogeneity and characterized them in established coagulation assays. Analysis of data suggests that although both FIXa variants exhibit equally dramatically impaired activity toward factor X in the intrinsic Tenase pathway, the G317E mutant zymogen is, nevertheless, activated with ~2-fold improved kcat in the extrinsic pathway. Furthermore, while both mutants are poorly inhibited by antithrombin (AT), the G317E mutant loses its reactivity with the serpin at a significantly higher rate particularly in the presence of pentasaccharide. These results suggest that the improved activation of FIX-G317E by the FVIIa-TF complex together with its dramatically poor reactivity with AT may be responsible for the less severe bleeding phenotype of the hemophilia B patient carrying this mutation. These results predict a key role for Gly-317 in the catalytic function of FIXa in the intrinsic pathway.
