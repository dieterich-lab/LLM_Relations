In the present study, pitavastatin produced a marked reduction not only in LDL-C, but also sd LDL-C levels. This result supported earlier clinical studies in which statin reduced sd LDL-C levels in patients with diabetes mellitus or familial hypercholesterolemia. Both LDL reductions were largely explained by the increased expression of LDL receptors due to the decreased synthesis of intrahepatic cholesterol. Sd LDL particles have been shown to have a weaker affinity for the LDL receptor than large buoyant LDL, while the induction of the LDL receptor by statin reportedly stimulates the uptake of all LDL particles, irrespective of their size. Thus, the pitavastatin-induced expression of LDL receptors may have enhanced the hepatic uptake of sd LDL in addition to LDL, which subsequently led to reductions in both LDL-C and sd LDL-C levels.
