Activation of Raf occurs via a complex, yet incompletely understood mechanism requiring membrane translocation, regulatory phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events and, crucially, allosteric activation in the context of a side-to-side dimer comprising two Raf molecules or a Raf and a Ksr molecule. Raf:Raf and Raf:Ksr dimerization depends on the dimer interface, a region located in the kinase domain, and in particular on a cluster of basic residues comprising B-RafR509, C-RafR401 and KsrR615. When these critical arginine residues are mutated to histidine (B-RafR509H, C-RafR401H, KsrR615H), activation does not take place. Conversely, the B-RafE586K mutation, which enhances dimerization and possibly allosteric transactivation, increases Erk signaling. Growth factor-induced Raf dimerization can also be inhibited by an 18 amino acid peptide able to bind C-Raf and B-Raf, resulting in decreased Mek activation.
