As many others in the field, my research group was engaged in the search (admittedly fruitless) for VRAC identity for a number of years. Therefore, with everything being in place, we were able to test if LRRC8A is important for VRAC function in brain cells within two weeks of the publication of study by Qiu et al.. Because of the pathological significance of swelling-activated excitatory amino acid release, we started with testing if LRRC8A is essential for this process. We found that primary rat astrocytes express LRRC8A, and that knockdown of astrocytic LRRC8A expression with several gene-specific siRNAs inhibits swelling-activated release of preloaded radiotracers d-[3H]aspartate and [14C]taurine by >70% (see representative data in Fig. 5). Findings with radiotracers were further validated for transport of the endogenous l-glutamate and taurine using HPLC. In addition to LRRC8A, we quantified expression for the other four members of the LRRC8 family and found that in primary astrocytes their expression levels (relative to LRRC8A) were 1 LRRC8A : ~2 LRRC8B : ~2 LRRC8C : ~2 LRRC8D (and very low expression of LRRC8E) ( see Fig. 5A). The absence of LRRC8E subunit may explain why, in astrocytes, VRAC currents show very modest time-dependent inactivation at highly negative potentials (see representative electrophysiology traces in Fig. 2A). Voss et al. found in erase-and-replace experiments that co-expression of LRRC8A with LRRC8E generates VRAC currents with dramatically "accelerated" inactivation at positive potentials.
