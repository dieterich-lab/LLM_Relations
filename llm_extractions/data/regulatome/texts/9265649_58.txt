Among the tubulin intermediate/cofactor complexes depicted in our model, FDbeta, FAbeta, and FBalpha are sufficiently stable to allow their biochemical isolation. The tubulin intermediates in these complexes are convertible to the native state only in the presence of GTP, tubulin itself, and other essential cofactors, i.e., C and E (in the case of FDbeta) or C, D, and E (in the case of FAbeta and FBalpha) (Fig. 4 E and). The FEalpha and FEalpha/FDbeta complexes are unstable during column chromatography and immunoprecipitation; hence the evidence for the existence of these species is necessarily circumstantial, but nonetheless compelling. We infer the existence of FEalpha from the following considerations: (a) since cofactor B can be omitted from productive alpha-tubulin folding reactions (albeit with a >90% loss of efficiency) (Fig. 4 C), cofactor E must be capable of capturing some c-cpn-generated intermediates, as it is the only alpha-tubulin binding cofactor present. (b) FEalpha can be stabilized and visualized in in vitro alpha-tubulin folding reactions after chemical cross-linking (Fig. 4 F). FEalpha interacts with FDbeta to form the FEalpha/FDbeta complex (marked with an asterisk in Figs. 4, 5 and 6) whose existence is in turn supported by the following data: (a) because of the high affinity of cofactor D for beta-tubulin, in the presence of excess tubulin heterodimer and the absence of cofactor C, cofactor D must be bound to beta-tubulin. Thus, the species marked with an asterisk generated in alpha-tubulin forward and backward reactions containing cofactors D, E, and tubulin must contain beta-tubulin in association with cofactor D. Moreover, this species is not formed in alpha-tubulin folding reactions in which native tubulin is omitted (Fig. 4 F), demonstrating that it is FDbeta and not cofactor D alone that interacts with FEalpha. (b) A species of the same mobility as that seen in alpha-tubulin folding reactions appears in beta-tubulin forward and reverse reactions (Figs. 5 A and 6 B, asterisk) and has been shown to contain cofactors D, E, and beta-tubulin. Since beta-tubulin cannot be productively folded without added native tubulin and cofactor E, we conclude that this too is the FEalpha/FDbeta complex.
