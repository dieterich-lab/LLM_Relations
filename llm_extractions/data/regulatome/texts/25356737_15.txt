To determine if WWP2 was a bona fide N3-ICD interacting protein, we first tested the interaction between rhN3-ICD-V5 and WWP2-GST proteins using an in vitro GST pull-down assay. The results demonstrated that rhN3-ICD-V5 was specifically pulled down by WWP2-GST in a dose-dependent fashion, but was not pulled down by GST-control peptides (Fig. 1B). Since WWP2 is a HECT-domain E3 ligase that regulates ubiquitin-dependent degradation of its substrates, we determined whether WWP2 promoted ubiquitination of Notch3 protein using in vitro ubiquitination assays. Recombinant WWP2-FLAG was incubated with rhN3-ICD-V5, ubiquitin (Ub), and the E1 and E2 enzymes. Ubiquitination of Notch3 protein was determined by immunoprecipitation using an anti-V5 antibody followed by Western blotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. We found that WWP2 induced heavy ubiquitination of N3-ICD (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrated that N3-ICD directly bound to WWP2, and that Notch3 was an ubiquitination substrate of WWP2.
