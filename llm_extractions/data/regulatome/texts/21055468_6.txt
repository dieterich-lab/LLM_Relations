We have previously observed no sign of MMP action in aggrecan degradation upon short-term (4-8 day) stimulation of cartilage explants with cytokines, while aggrecanases always remained the major aggrecan-cleaving activity detected in the tissue. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible mechanisms explaining the lack of detectable aggrecanolytic MMP activity in cartilage and assess the relative contribution of MMPs to aggrecan proteolysis in later stages of cytokine-stimulation. In addition, the relative efficiencies of aggrecanases and various MMPs on aggrecan IGD and CS-2 cleavage were also determined.
