ROCK1, and probably other kinases, phosphorylate RhoBTB1 on multiple sites, promoting or inhibiting its interaction with Cullin3. This could thereby increase or decrease targeting of RhoBTB1-interacting proteins for degradation by Cullin3 ubiquitin ligases. Although ROCK1 associates with RhoBTB1, based on our results it is unlikely to be a target for Cul3-mediated degradation, and thus the identification of other RhoBTB1-binding proteins will be important to determine which proteins are targets for RhoBTB1/Cul3-mediated degradation. Changes in the levels of these proteins could, in turn, contribute to the cell shape changes induced by RhoBTB1 depletion.
