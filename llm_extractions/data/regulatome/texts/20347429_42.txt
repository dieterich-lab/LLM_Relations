Consistent with their possession of the histone-fold, the MHF proteins assemble into a stoichiometric, heterodimeric complex that possesses a DNA binding activity. Our biochemical studies have shown a preference of the MHF1-MHF2 dimer for the Holliday structure over several other DNA substrates. Importantly, our results have revealed that the MHF1-MHF2 dimer interacts directly with FANCM via MHF1, and that the protein dimer strongly enhances the DNA branch migration activity of FANCM in a manner that is dependent on FANCM's ability to hydrolyze ATP. These properties of the MHF1-MHF2 dimer distinguish it from the FANCM-associated factor FAAP24, which also binds DNA but, unlike MHF1-MHF2, exerts no stimulatory effect on FANCM's ability to process branched DNA substrates.
