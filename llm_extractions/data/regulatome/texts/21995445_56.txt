In previous studies we examined mutations in CFTR that both enhanced and inhibited endocytosis, and neither one of these mutations affected CFTR protein half-life. Furthermore, in the present studies, mu2 depletion only had a modest effect on CFTR half-life. Therefore it is unclear why the block at the sorting endosome stage would have a dramatic effect on CFTR's half-life in Dab2 depleted cells. This was even more surprising since previous studies reported that blocking the exit from the recycling endosome has no effect on CFTR expression levels, suggesting that the half-life was not affected. Therefore in order to gain a deeper understanding of this mechanism, we examined how CFTR transport to the late endosome was affected in Dab2 depleted cells. The results indicated that Dab2 is necessary for CFTR delivery into the degradation compartment. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that depletion of the C-terminal Eps15 homology domain 4 (EDH4) by siRNA leads to the generation of enlarged early endosomal structures that contain Rab5 and EEA1 and accumulation of LDL particles destined for degradation. Because the LDL particles accumulated rather than being delivered to the late endosome and lysosome, the authors suggested that EDH4 KD indicated that EDH4 was not only involved in the recycling of molecules through the sorting endosome, but also in delivery of cargo destined for degradation. Based on the similar phenotype of the enlargement of the sorting endosome where recycling receptors and cargo are trapped, it is tempting to speculate that the myosin VI and Dab2 are required for efficient exit from the sorting endosome for delivery to both the recycling compartment and the late endosome, and therefore Dab2 is required at multiple steps in the endocytic pathway.
