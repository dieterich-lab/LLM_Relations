The kinetic constants of the interaction of Shh with GPC5 were measured using a biosensor system (Biacore 3000; GE Healthcare). 15 microg of soluble GPC5-AP fusion protein, which was purified from the conditioned medium of GPC5-AP-transfected 293T cells, was biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and one third of the biotinylated GPC5-AP was treated with HSase II and CSase ABC in the presence of protease inhibitors to remove GAG chains. Glycanated and nonglycanated GPC5-AP were individually immobilized (1,000 response units) in flow cells 2 and 3 on a sensorchip (SA; GE Healthcare). A similar amount of biotinylated AP was immobilized in flow cell 1 to use as a correction reference for nonspecific binding. The indicated concentrations of ShhN (R&D Systems) in running buffer HBS-EP (10-mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150-mM NaCl, 3-mM EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20; GE Healthcare) were injected over flow cells at 30 ml/min for 90 s at 25degreesC. After a 3-min wash with HBS-EP, the flow cells were regenerated with 1-min pulses of HBS-EP containing 2-M NaCl.
