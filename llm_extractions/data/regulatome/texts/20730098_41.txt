When added to PRP, LAIR-2/Fc but not LAIR-1/Fc was able to interfere with collagen-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 2). LAIR-2/Fc mediated inhibition was found to be dose-dependent and specific, given that no inhibition was observed upon TRAP-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 2). A LAIR-2/Fc specific inhibition of platelet-collagen interactions was also observed in in vitro perfusion experiments. The addition of LAIR-2/Fc to anticoagulated whole blood resulted in a dramatic decrease in the deposition of platelets when perfused over a collagen surface, both at low (300 s-1) and high (1500 s-1) shear rates (Fig. 3). Since different receptors dominate the interactions between platelets and collagen at low and high shear rates, our findings indicate that LAIR-2/Fc is able to interfere with the action of more than one collagen-receptor. Indeed, whereas LAIR-2/Fc was unable to interfere with the interaction between collagen and alpha2beta1, LAIR-2/Fc but not LAIR-1/Fc inhibited binding of collagen to GpVI-expressing cells as well as binding of VWF to collagen (Figs. 4 and 5). These data are in agreement with the perfusion data, in that GpVI is important in the adhesion of platelets to collagen under low shear rate conditions, whereas VWF is pertinent to the adhesion of platelets to collagen under high shear rate conditions.
