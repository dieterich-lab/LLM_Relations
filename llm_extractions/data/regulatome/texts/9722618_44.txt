Immunoblot analyses of p21WAF1 levels before and after NGF treatment in wild-type PC12 cells clearly showed an increase after 48 h. However, in NAB2-overexpressing cell lines, p21WAF1 levels were dramatically downregulated (Fig. 7). Not only the induced level of p21WAF1 expression, but also the basal level (in the absence of NGF) was strongly decreased in NAB2-overexpressing cell lines. This effect on p21WAF1 levels was specific, as the levels of another cdi, p27Kip1, and cyclin D1 were unaffected.
