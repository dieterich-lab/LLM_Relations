As predicted, at the low levels of CD8/LDLR expression induced in the presence of 25 ng/ml tet (Fig. S1), CCPs increased in intensity (Fig. 1, E-G), suggesting an increase in CCP size and/or clustering of CCPs. EM analysis of the ventral surface of cells revealed the appearance of larger flat lattices (Fig. 1 H), up to 500 nm in diameter (Table I), and clusters of CCPs (Fig. 1, F and H; see also Fig. 3 Ba) that were not detected under control conditions. Strikingly, at the high levels of overexpression achieved upon complete removal of tet, Dab2 was strongly recruited to the plasma membrane and induced the formation of giant clathrin-coated structures (GCCSs). These were selectively located on the ventral surface, irregular in shape, and reached several micrometers in diameter (Fig. 1, I-L, Fig. S2 B, and Video 1). EM revealed these to be flat lattices (Table I) and not clusters of CCPs. GCCS formation was dependent on Dab2 expression, as they were not detected in cells overexpressing CD8/LDLR alone (Fig. S2, E and F; see also Fig. 4, C and D). When TfnRs were overexpressed, even in the presence of Dab2 (Fig. S2 C), we did not detect an effect on CCP size or the appearance of GCCSs by immunofluorescence. Indeed, in our studies, CCPs detected by EM on the dorsal surface of BSC1 cells overexpressing TfnR alone were smaller than in control cells (Table I). These findings differ from an earlier study in which the assembly of flat clathrin lattices was induced by overexpression of human TfnR in chicken fibroblasts, which may reflect species or cell type differences. Together, these results demonstrate a continuum in the size of CCPs dependent on the expression levels of Dab2 and cargo: both Dab2 and CD8/LDLR overexpression are required for the formation of GCCSs.
