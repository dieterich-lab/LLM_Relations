Drugs that target mutant alleles such as G12C, such as that described above, and another by obviously offer the best opportunity for safety and efficacy. However, strategies for targeting mutant proteins such as G12D and G12V have not yet been forthcoming. Therefore, drugs that do not discriminate between wild-type and mutant forms may be an inevitable compromise. RAS proteins are essential for transducing signals from all RTKs, as well as many GPCRs. Therefore, we expect that pan-RAS inhibitors would be unacceptably toxic. Indeed, ablation of all three RAS genes in most adult tissues is fatal in mice. However, adult mice can survive for ~1 year following ablation of only KRAS (M. Barbacid, personal communication). Drugs that ablate KRAS, but spare HRAS and NRAS, are likely to be tolerated. While this appears to simplify strategies for treating KRAS driven cancers, the fact that the KRAS gene encodes two splice variants, KRAS4a and KRAS4b, creates another challenge. Developing compounds that inhibit both forms of KRAS without affecting HRAS and NRAS will be difficult. Targeting KRAS4b alone might be effective, as KRAS4b is expressed at higher levels than KRAS4a in most tumors and has unique biochemical properties. KRAS4b binds calmodulin and is a substrate for phosphorylation by PKC. KRAS4b, unlike other RAS proteins, promotes expansion of endoderm stem cells and promotes a stem-like program through its interaction with Ca/Calmodulin, referred to above. However, it is currently unclear how effective a drug would be if it only targeted KRAS4b. KRAS4a is clearly capable of causing tumors. Indeed, Kirsten sarcoma virus is an activated form of KRAS4a.
