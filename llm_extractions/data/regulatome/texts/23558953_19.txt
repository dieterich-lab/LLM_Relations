Activating point mutations of FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 or FGFR4 have been identified in a variety of cancers including gliomas, bladder cancer, multiple myeloma, and rhabdomyosarcomas. Studies of hematological diseases led to the identification of 3' gene fusions of FGFR1 in myeloproliferative disorder and 3' FGFR3 fusions in peripheral T-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma. As described earlier, 5' gene fusions of FGFR1 and FGFR3 with TACC1 and TACC3 have recently been identified in GBM in two studies. Here, we identify potentially actionable 5' and 3' FGFR rearrangements across a diverse array of both common and rare solid tumors. Ten novel FGFR fusion partners were identified. In the Singh et al GBM study, the mechanism of activation of the FGFR fusions is proposed to be through mis-localization to mitotic spindle poles mediated by the coiled-coil domain of TACC fusion partner. This presumably leads to mitotic and chromosomal segregation defects triggering aneuploidy. In the Parker et al GBM study, increased expression through loss of the FGFR3 3' UTR and miR-99a regulation is hypothesized as an activating mechanism. While these may be potential mechanisms in the specific case of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins in GBM, this likely does not explain the diverse array of fusion partners identified for FGFRs in this study. We propose a different, potentially more inclusive, model in which the FGFR fusion partners (e.g., BICC1, TACC3, CCDC6, BAIAP2L1, KIAA1967, CASP7, CIT, and OFD1) mediate oligomerization, which triggers activation of the respective FGFR kinase. Of note, we have not detected any FGFR fusions that result in simple truncation of the FGFR protein, despite prior investigations suggesting that 3' truncating splicing isoforms encode activated FGFR2 proteins. The FGFR fusions detected have persistently exhibited substantial dimerization domain contributions from the 3' fusion partner.
