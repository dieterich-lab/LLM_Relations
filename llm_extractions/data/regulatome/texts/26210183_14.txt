TRC8 function likely extends beyond the degradation of TA proteins. Its sterol sensing domain suggests an involvement in membrane lipid homeostasis, though the role of TRC8 in the processing of SREBP transcription factors and sterol-induced degradation of HMG-CoA reductase remains controversial. The study of US2 has therefore uncovered a novel branch of mammalian ERAD with an E3 ligase involved in channel-independent degradation and lipid homeostasis.
