To further define the nature of the angiogenic defect observed in DiYF mice, we compared angiogenesis-relevant functions of ECs isolated from WT and DiYF mice. We first assessed whether the mutation in beta3 integrin cytoplasmic domain had any effect on EC adhesion and subsequent cell spreading on extracellular matrix substrates. WT and DiYF ECs were plated on various integrin ligands and numbers of attached and spread cells per field were counted. WT and DiYF ECs adhered and spread equally well on fibronectin, laminin-1, and collagen-coated plates (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, a significant difference (P < 0.001) in the behavior of WT and DiYF ECs was found using the alphavbeta3 ligands vitronectin and entactin. On these substrates, DiYF ECs showed a twofold reduction in adhesion and a fourfold decrease in the number of spread cells on vitronectin and threefolds on entactin (Fig. 5, A and B). To further examine the role of beta3 integrin cytoplasmic tyrosine motifs in regulation of receptor ligand-binding strength, we examined cell adhesion under conditions of shear stress. WT and excessive DiYF endothelial cells were plated on vitronectin-coated glass coverslips to achieve equal number of adherent cells. Then, adherent cells were subjected to perfusion with shear rates of 5-30 dyn/cm2 for 1 min. As shown in Fig. 5 C, shear stress revealed a dramatic difference in strength of adhesion between WT and DiYF endothelial cells. Shear stress of 10 to 15 dyne/cm2 almost completely abolishes DiYF endothelial cell adhesion to vitronectin, whereas >60% of WT endothelial cells remained tightly adhered to the matrix. Shear rate sufficient to wash away 50% of adherent cells was 23 and 8 dyne/cm2 for WT and DiYF endothelial cells, respectively (Fig. 5 C). This finding demonstrates that beta3 integrin cytoplasmic tyrosine motifs regulates ligand-binding strength.
