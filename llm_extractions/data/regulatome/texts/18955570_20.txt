To reproduce the GM-CSF receptor signaling defect identified in this family, plasmids expressing CSF2RB and either CSF2RAG174R or CSF2RAWT were cotransfected into 293 cells. Western blotting showed receptor proteins of the expected size from CSF2RAWT and smaller molecular forms from CSF2RAG174R (Fig. 4 A), which is similar to results for primary leukocytes (Fig. 2 B). Treatment of transduced cell lysates with Peptide: N-Glycosidase F, an amidase that cleaves between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagine residues of high mannose oligosaccharides, resulted in a similar electrophoretic pattern for normal and G174R GM-CSF-Ralpha. This confirmed the G174R mutation alters N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 4 A) by disrupting a functional N-linked glycosylation site and that glycosylation is responsible for the smaller molecular forms from this allele. GM-CSF-Rbeta was expressed in CSF2RB-transfected cells but was undetectable in nontransfected cells (unpublished data). GM-CSF binding studies demonstrated that cells expressing CSF2RAWT and CSF2RB rapidly bound GM-CSF and removed it from the media, whereas cells expressing CSF2RAG174R and CSF2RB or CSF2RB alone did not clear GM-CSF (Fig. 4 B). Cotransfection of CSF2RB together with CSF2RAWT, but not with CSF2RAG174R, resulted in expression of functional GM-CSF receptors as demonstrated by GM-CSF-dependent phosphorylation of STAT5 only with the former combination (Fig. 4 C). Incubation of CSF2RAG174R/CSF2RB-transduced cells with higher concentrations of GM-CSF in the range of those observed in the index patient gave results similar to those obtained with primary leukocytes and clearly demonstrated a modest dose-dependent increase in STAT5 phosphorylation, which is consistent with a partial rescue of the signaling abnormality (Fig. 4 D).
