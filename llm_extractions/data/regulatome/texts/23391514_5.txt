The eukaryotic MutSalpha complex is the evolutionary product of gene duplication and divergence of homodimeric MutS. This process has resulted in two distinct proteins required for initiation of MMR, as well as for additional functions that are not required of the bacterial MMR system. MSH2 and MSH6 share five similar domains, but with sufficient differences to give MSH6 several distinct functions. MSH6 also has a unique N-terminal disordered domain that is absent in its MSH2 partner. The human MSH6 protein was first reported in 1995 as G/T mismatch Binding Protein (GTBP), binding partner of hMSH2 to form the MutSalpha complex. The human MSH6 gene includes 10 exons that encompass a total genomic sequence of 24 kilobases, and is located on the petite arm of chromosome 2 (2p16.3), within one megabase of hMSH2. The hMSH6 gene product is a 160 kDa protein that is unstable without heterodimerization with hMSH2, and consequently utilizes 80%-90% of available hMSH2.
