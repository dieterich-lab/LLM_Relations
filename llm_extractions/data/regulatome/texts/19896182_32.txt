The loading of Mcm2-7 requires ORC, Cdc6 and hydrolysable ATP, consistent with requirements in vivo. The requirement for Cdt1 was not tested because it is an integral component of the Mcm2-7 complex. The interaction of Cdt1 with both Mcm2-7 and Orc6, suggests that it may act as a bridge between ORC and Mcm2-7. However, our results demonstrate that Cdc6 is also essential to recruit Mcm2-7 to origins, indicating that additional interactions are involved in this recruitment.
