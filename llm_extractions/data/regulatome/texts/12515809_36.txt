The major contribution of DC-SIGN to the interaction of immature DCs with ManLAM prompted us to investigate whether DC-SIGN was also important in the interaction of immature DCs to viable mycobacteria. Immature DCs interacted strongly with M. bovis BCG (Fig. 3 c). Strikingly, DC-SIGN is an important receptor for M. bovis BCG, as the antibodies against DC-SIGN strongly inhibited the infection of immature DCs with M. bovis BCG (Fig. 3 c). Antibodies against MR, CD11b, and CD11c did not inhibit the infection, whereas the C-type lectin inhibitor mannan blocked the infection to a similar level as the DC-SIGN antibodies (Fig. 3 c). Moreover, the MR-ligand mannose-BSA did not inhibit the interaction of DCs with M. bovis BCG (Fig. 3 c) demonstrating that the C-type lectin domains of MR are not involved in M. bovis BCG infection of DCs. Both the anti-MR antibody and mannose-BSA are inhibitors of MR function as they block binding of another MR-ligand, dextran, to DCs (unpublished data). These results demonstrate that DC-SIGN is an important C-type lectin on DCs that functions as a receptor for M. bovis BCG. Other nonlectin receptors may contribute to the interaction, as the infection was not completely inhibited by antibodies against DC-SIGN (Fig. 3 c).
