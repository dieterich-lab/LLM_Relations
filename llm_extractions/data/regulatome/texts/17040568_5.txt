TGFbeta superfamily proteins produce their effects in target cells by binding complexes of type I and type II receptor serine/threonine kinases. For activins, the ligand binding type II receptors are ACVR2A and ACVR2B. Once bound, these receptors phosphorylate the type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase 4 (ALK4; ACVR1B), in a juxtamembrane domain called the GS box. This activates the type I receptor, allowing it to phosphorylate intracellular effectors such as the Smads. A second type I receptor, ALK2 (also known as ACVR1), was shown to bind activin A, but does not appear to transduce the ligand's intracellular signals. Thus, ALK4 has conventionally been considered the only type I receptor for the activins.
