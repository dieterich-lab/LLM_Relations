Recruitment of the Rabs occurs at specific early/recycling endosome tubular domains, but they are also present on melanosomes, suggesting that they remain bound to vesicles until fusion with the downstream melanosome. These results constitute a step forward in our understanding of these pathways but also open other questions. What are the functions of Rab32 and Rab38? What are the effectors of Rab32 and Rab38 that facilitate trafficking to and fusion with melanosomes? What proteins are important for the regulation of Rab32 and Rab38? Little is known about the protein effectors of Rab32 and Rab38 beyond interaction with the protein Varp, which is implicated in the recruitment of the v-SNARE VAMP-7/TI-VAMP and Tyrp1 traffic. This Rab-Varp interaction is likely important for the vesicle-melanosome fusion event. Potential interactions of Rab32 and Rab38 with tethering proteins such as the HOmotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex could also facilitate trafficking or fusion of vesicles with melanosomes. Supporting this possibility, mutation of the HOPS complex subunit Vps33a results in deficient melanosome biogenesis in the buff mouse. However, the precise mechanisms that control the movement and targeting of vesicles remain unclear. The mechanisms used by Rab32 and Rab38 in the trafficking of transmembrane cargoes to melanosomes, and perhaps other LROs, will doubtless be investigated in future studies.
