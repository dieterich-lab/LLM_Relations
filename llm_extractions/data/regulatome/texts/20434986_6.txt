NLRs represent a large family of intracellular PRRs that are characterized by a conserved nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, and are involved in the activation of diverse signaling pathways. Several NLRs, such as NOD1, NOD2 and NALP3, have been extensively studied and shown to activate signaling pathways once they encounter relevant PAMPs (; Chen et al.). NALP3 inflammasome, for example, functions as a crucial component in the adjuvant effect of aluminium and asbestos. More recently, NLRX1 was demonstrated to function as a mitochondrial protein that interacts with the mitochondrial adaptor MAVS to inhibit the RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway and triggers the generation of reactive oxygen species as well. These studies suggest that understanding the function and mechanisms of these innate immune receptors or regulators may aid in developing more effective strategies for the immunological treatment of inflammation-associated diseases.
