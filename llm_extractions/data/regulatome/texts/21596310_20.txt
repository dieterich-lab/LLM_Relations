To validate these ChIP-chip results in an independent experiment, we performed manual ChIP assays in MCF7 cells using two different L3MBTL2 antibodies (see Figure S3E) and confirmed that L3MBTL2 and E2F6 bind to the high confidence binding sites identified by ChIP-chip, for instance to the promoter regions of RAD51C, UXT, RPA2 and CDC7 (Figure S3E). We also examined if L3MBTL2 and E2F6 target the same sites in other cell lines, specifically HeLa and 293F. Our ChIP assay analysis suggested that the majority of sites are also occupied in 293F cells including CDC7, CSTF3, MCM3, UXT, RPA2, RAD51C, RFC3 and HOXC5. Some genes were found to be occupied in all three cell lines, such as CDC7, while certain genes, for instance MCM3, were occupied by L3MBTL2 and E2F6 in MCF7 and 293F, but not in HeLa cells (Figure S3F, G). Well known PcG protein target genes like HOXC13 and MYT1 were not found among L3MBTL2 target genes, either by ChIP-chip or a manual ChIP assay approach (Table S3, Figure S3G). Re-examination of the CDC7 gene by manual ChIP analysis (with primer sets that hybridize to proximal and distal regions of the CDC7 TSS) showed that L3MBTL2 binding was only evident at the proximal promoter and not 2 kb upstream or downstream of the TSS (Figure S3H).
