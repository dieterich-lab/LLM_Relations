To further characterize the HJ processing activity of human SLX1-SLX4, we compared its ability to resolve a chi structure with that of the canonical RusA bacterial HJ resolvase. This much larger HJ substrate more closely resembles HJs found in vivo with a large 300 bp core of homology and long duplex arms ranging from 0.45 to 2.15 kb. It was previously used to characterize the HJ resolving activities of bacterial and phages resolvases. Resolution of the chi structure yields two pairs of nicked duplex products following dual incisions on strands A and C or B and D (Figure 4C). Like RusA, SLX1-SLX4 efficiently resolved the chi structure into all four duplex products (Figure 4D). A bias towards dual incisions on strands B and D was observed for RusA in agreement with a previous report (Figure 4D). In contrast, like RuvC, SLX1-SLX4 did not display any bias (Figure 4D).
