To further examine the presence of RPA in the two putative NER subcomplexes at sites of UV damage, we performed a modified protocol of the classical chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of in vivo cross-linked confluent NHFs and analyzed the coprecipitated proteins by Western blotting. In line with our previously published data, XPB-specific ChIP yields an increased interaction of XPB with preincision factors such as XPA and RPA in UV-irradiated cells, whereas post-incision factors, i.e., Poldelta, Lig3, and XRCC1, are virtually absent (Fig. 8 A), confirming that, also in vivo, NER subcomplexes involved in pre- or post-incision stages reside at different repair sites. When cells are treated with HU and AraC before UV irradiation, the XPB interaction with XPA is further enhanced (Fig. 8 A). This is consistent with the 1.2-fold increased accumulation of NER factors that we observed at UV spots in the presence of inhibitors (Fig. 5 C). However, treatment of cells with HU and AraC has the opposite effect on the interaction between XPB and RPA. These results suggest that the number of chromatin-bound NER subcomplexes that contain both XPB and RPA are reduced when NER synthesis is impaired. The opposite is evident when we perform ChIP-on-Western with an XRCC1 antibody; a clear UV-increased interaction can be found between XRCC1, RPA, and Poldelta, which is further enhanced in the presence of HU and AraC (Fig. 8 B). This is in agreement with the increased association of DNA synthesis factors (including RPA) at sites of incomplete DNA repair synthesis. As reported previously, the ratio between XRCC1 and Lig3 is not significantly altered by the UV irradiation.
