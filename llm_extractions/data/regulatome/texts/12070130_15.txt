The cytoplasmic domain of L1, with the RSLE alternatively spliced sequence, with a truncation at amino acid 1,182, or with serine1194 mutated to leucine, bound to ezrin. Baits: L1+RSLE (L1 COOH terminus with the RSLE alternatively spliced sequence), L1-RSLE (L1 COOH terminus without RSLE), L1DeltaY (L1 COOH terminus with tyrosine adjacent to RSLE motif mutated to phenylalanine), L1trunc (L1 COOH terminus truncated at amino acid residue 1,182, E of the RSLE motif), L1RSLEDeltaS (containing RSLE but with serine1194 of the rat sequence mutated to leucine). Trapped clones: ezrin, ankyrin, AP2.
