Pre-tRNAs are believed to be processed mainly in nucleus. We therefore predicted that hetADAT should also be located in nucleus in order to modify pre-tRNAs. We decided to address this question by performing confocal microscopy. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect endogenous ADAT2 or ADAT3 by immunohistochemistry in human cell lines using commercially available antibodies so we chose to express fluorescently tagged proteins. To avoid misleading results, we cloned human ADAT2 and human ADAT3 as N-term or C-term fusion proteins with two different fluorophores: GFP and mCherry (eight constructs in total). By doing so, we could rule out potential localization artifacts due to the presence of a particular type of fluorophore or whether the fluorophore was fused to the N-term or the C-term of the protein. Additionally, expressing fluorescent proteins allowed us to perform live imaging, ruling out artifacts often observed by immunohistochemistry due to cell fixation protocols. As observed in Figure 3 (upper panel), GFP- or mCherry-tagged ADAT2 localized mainly to nucleus and partially to the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, GFP- or mCherry-tagged ADAT3 localized mainly to cytoplasm and only partially to nucleus (Figure 3 centre panel). Given that ADAT2 and ADAT3 are expected to work as a heterodimer, we thought that the localization might be dependent on the stoichiometry of the subunits. We therefore co-expressed GFP-tagged ADAT2 and mCherry-tagged ADAT3 and found both subunits co-localizing in nucleus (Figure 3 lower panel). Similar results were obtained with either combination of the eight different fluorescently-tagged proteins (Supplementary Figure S7). While it is nevertheless important to verify the subcellular localization of the endogenous ADAT2 and ADAT3; these results suggest that hetADAT acts mainly in nucleus and that ADAT3 translocates to nucleus in an ADAT2-dependent manner.
