It is unlikely that Fz7 or Wnt11 molecules directly modulate cell adhesion, nor do our data support a critical role of downstream signaling through Wnt11 effectors such as RhoA and Rok2 in this process. One possibility is that Wnt11-induced Fz7-accumulations interact with an adhesion molecule mediating these adhesive functions. Several lines of evidence point to the involvement of the atypical cadherin Fmi, a key component of PCP signaling in D. melanogaster. Previous work showed a functional interaction between Fmi and Wnt11 in controlling convergent extension movements during zebrafish gastrulation. In addition, Fmi exhibits adhesive function in cultures of dissociated zebrafish embryonic cells, as well as in D. melanogaster S2 cell cultures (; unpublished results). We not only found that Fmi colocalizes with Fz7 accumulations but also discovered that endogenous Fmi function is required for the cell contact persistence mediated by Fz7 accumulation. Collectively, our data strongly suggests that Fmi plays a key role in controlling cell adhesion at sites of Wnt11-induced Fz7 accumulation.
