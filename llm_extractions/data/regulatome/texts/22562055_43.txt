The addition of pharmacological PLA2 inhibitors or anti-cPLA2alpha antibody to cytosol in their reconstitution assay increased vesicle formation and concomitantly decreased tubule formation, which was reversed by the addition of purified cPLA2alpha. Their model posits that Arf1 and COPI coatomer recruitment initiates bud formation and that buds then mature into either vesicles or membrane tubules, depending on the balance of cPLA2alpha and AGPAT3/LPAAT3 activity (Fig. 2, Step 5: Fig. 4B-E). It is still a matter of debate as to whether generation of curve-inducing PA or recruitment of effector proteins, is most important in AGPAT3/LPAAT3-mediated vesicle biogenesis. They further suggest that AGPAT3/LPAAT3 generated PA initiates negative membrane curvature but is insufficient for complete vesicle budding, a process that is finalized by the additional generation of PA by PLD2 (Fig. 4F). The generation of PA by both enzymes could aid in the recruitment of the fission protein BARS. Hsu and colleagues also assert that the biogenesis of Golgi membrane tubules, both intercisternal and intracisternal, which facilitate anterograde trafficking and Golgi ribbon formation respectively, are initiated as COPI buds (Fig. 4D). These results provide important insights into how Lands cycle phospholipid remodeling might influence the dynamic behavior of Golgi membranes. Interestingly, however, this model of membrane curvature initiation solely by COPI/Arfs cannot explain enhanced Golgi membrane tubule formation by BFA or knockdown of Arf GEFs, and underscores the notion that cytoplasmic PLA2 enzymes can induce membrane tubules on their own (Fig. 4G). In addition, because COPI vesicle budding and fission can be reconstituted using minimal components coatomer and Arf-GTP, these phospholipid modifying enzymes likely function to enhance the efficiency of the COPI budding machinery.
