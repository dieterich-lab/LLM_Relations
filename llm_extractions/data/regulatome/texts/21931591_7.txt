The molecular mechanisms regulating RIP3 and RIP4 functions remain poorly understood, and whether ubiquitination plays a regulatory function is unknown. Because IAPs were shown to be critical regulators of RIP1 and RIP2, we investigated whether they also participate in the regulation of RIP3- and RIP4-mediated functions. We found that XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 bind to RIP3 and RIP4, and that cIAP1 and cIAP2 function as direct E3-ubiquitin ligases for all four RIP proteins. By performing in vitro ubiquitination reactions, we found that cIAP1 not only conjugate RIP proteins with Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains but also with head-to-tail linear ubiquitin chains. Consistent with these findings, we found that repressing cIAP1/2 levels by the use of the IAP antagonist BV6 attenuated activation of NF-kappaB that is dependent on RIP1, -2, -3 and -4 (hereafter RIP1-4). Finally, we identified two lysines of RIP4 that play a critical role in cIAP1-mediated ubiquitination and NF-kappaB activation. Together, our results provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms controlling the members of the RIP family.
