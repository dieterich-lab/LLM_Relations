The mitochondrial inner membrane protein ABCB10 or ABCme (ATP binding cassette B10 or mitochondrial erythroid) was initially identified when studying genes up-regulated during erythroid differentiation by the transcription factor GATA-1. Consistent with this, ABCB10 was found to be essential for primitive erythropoiesis in vivo and for proper hemoglobin synthesis of erythroid cells. However, ABCB10 is also expressed in non-erythroid tissues, such as the heart, which suggests a role of ABCB10 beyond hemoglobin synthesis. In this regard, inactivation of one allele of ABCB10 did not affect basal cardiac function, but markedly decreased heart recovery after acute induction of oxidative stress by ischemia-reperfusion. These cardiac defects induced by ischemia-reperfusion in ABCB10 +/- hearts were completely prevented by a 20 minutes pre-treatment with antioxidants. Thus, ABCB10 plays a role protecting from increased oxidative stress in the mitochondria. Indeed, antioxidant treatments partially rescued hemoglobin synthesis in ABCB10 null erythroid cells. However, the exact mechanism by which ABCB10 protects mitochondria from oxidative stress has not been identified, as the molecular entities transported by ABCB10 remain elusive.
