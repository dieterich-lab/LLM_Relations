An important step in RLC formation is the initial binding of the double-stranded siRNA duplex. Dicer and Ago2 appear to be less capable of binding siRNA alone, while TRBP shows a relatively higher affinity (KD ~1-100nM; data not shown and). When in solution, TRBP homodimerizes, which may contribute to TRBP forming multimeric complexes on dsRNA even as short as 21 base-pairs (e.g., siRNA; Figure 2 and Figure S1 of the Supporting Information) in an uncooperative manner. This suggests that TRBP is functionally distinct from dsRBPs that show improved binding with dsRNA length, such as C. elegans RDE-4. Consistent with what has been observed for other dsRBPs and with dsRBD function in general, TRBP was unable to bind double-stranded siDNA or RNA/DNA hybrids (Figure 2 and 5). Though some DNA substitutions are tolerated in siRNAs for gene silencing, substitutions at the 3'-end disrupted silencing, presumably by impairing TRBP binding. These results are in agreement with our observations (Figure 2 and 5), and it would be interesting to see how shorter DNA segments spread throughout the siRNA would impact binding and crosslinking by TRBP.
