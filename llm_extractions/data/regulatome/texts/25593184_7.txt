Given that RPA-ssDNA is a key HR intermediate, we asked if ATRX loss induces ALT. Knockdown of ATRX in HeLa cells did not inactivate telomerase, nor did it induce telomere lengthening (Fig. S10A-B). These results are consistent with a previous study and suggest that loss of ATRX is insufficient to establish ALT. Nevertheless, ATRX knockdown in HeLa cells promoted some features of ALT, such as the persistent association of TERRA and RPA with telomeres. Interestingly, a recent study showed that loss of the histone chaperone ASF1 led to the acquisition of several ALT phenotypes, including accumulation of RPA at telomeres. We postulate that ALT is established via a multistep process in which loss of ATRX poises telomeres for ALT, but additional genetic/epigenetic changes are needed to fully activate the ALT pathway (see Fig. S29).
