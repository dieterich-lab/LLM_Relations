Cloning of human lysyl hydroxylase: complete cDNA-derived amino acid sequence and assignment of the gene (PLOD) to chromosome 1p36.3----p36.2.  Lysyl hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.4), an alpha 2 dimer, catalyzes the formation of hydroxylysine in collagens by the hydroxylation of lysine residues in peptide linkages. A deficiency in this enzyme activity is known to exist in patients with the type VI variant of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but no amino acid sequence data have been available for the wildtype or mutated human enzyme from any source. We report the isolation and characterization of cDNA clones for lysyl hydroxylase from a human placenta lambda gt11 cDNA library. The cDNA clones cover almost all of the 3.2-kb mRNA, including all the coding sequences. These clones encode a polypeptide of 709 amino acid residues and a signal peptide of 18 amino acids. The human coding sequences are 72% identical to the recently reported chick sequences at the nucleotide level and 76% identical at the amino acid level. The C-terminal region is especially well conserved, a 139-amino-acid region, residues 588-727 (C-terminus), being 94% identical between the two species and a 76-amino-acid region, residues 639-715, 99% identical. These comparisons, together with other recent data, suggest that lysyl hydroxylase may contain functionally significant sequences especially in its C-terminal region. The human lysyl hydroxylase gene (PLOD) was mapped to chromosome 1 by Southern blot analysis of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids, to the 1p34----1pter region by using cell hybrids that contain various translocations of human chromosome 1, and by in situ hybridization to 1p36.2----1p36.3. This gene is thus not physically linked to those for the alpha and beta subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, which are located on chromosomes 10 and 17, respectively.
