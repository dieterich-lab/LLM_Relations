As suggested above, if the hMSH6-H3K36me3 interaction recruits hMutSalpha to chromatin in vivo, then it could be essential for MMR in vivo. If this prediction is correct, cells lacking or depleted for H3K36me3 will be MMR-deficient and have an increased mutation frequency. To explore this prediction, control and SETD2-depleted HeLa cells were tested for MSI at four microsatellite loci as described. The results (Figure 5A) show no MSI in control HeLa cells, while 4 out of 14 (28.6%) subclones from SETD2/H3K36me3-depleted HeLa cells showed either new microsatellite species (asterisk) or deletion of a microsatellite mark (Delta). As a positive control, MSI was also analyzed in hMSH6-deficient DLD-1 cells, and the results show new repeat species in 6 out of 15 (40%) subclones (Figure S3). Despite a difference in the percentage of subclones showing new repeat species, the data clearly demonstrate that like hMSH6-deficient DLD-1 cells, SETD2/H3K36me3-depleted HeLa cells display MSI.
