Sequence analysis of the ARL7 5'-flanking region identified two DR-4 LXR response elements (LXREs; Direct Repeats with a 4 nucleotide spacer) at -1405 bp and -5215 bp relative to the transcription start site (Fig. 7A). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay were performed to test the ability of LXR/RXR heterodimers to bind the putative ARL7 LXREs. As shown in Fig. 7B, in vitro translated LXRalpha and RXRalpha protein bound to a radiolabeled oligonucleotide spanning the ARL7 LXRE sequence. By contrast, a mutated version of this sequence was unable to bind LXR/RXR. Addition of an LXR produced a supershifted complex, confirming the presence of LXR in the protein-DNA complex In addition, an excess of unlabeled wild-type but not mutant ARL7 LXRE was able to compete for complex formation (Fig. 7C).
