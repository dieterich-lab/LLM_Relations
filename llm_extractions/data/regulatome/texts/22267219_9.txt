We utilized Irf4-/-Irf8-/- (called Irf4,8 -/- hereafter) pre-B cells, a model system for analyzing large cycling pre-B cells that express both the IL-7R and the pre-BCR, to determine if IL-7 signaling in these cells negatively regulates the expression of Foxo family transcription factors via the activation of the PI(3)K-Akt module. Lowering of IL-7 concentration in the culture medium substantially induced the amounts of Foxo1 and Foxo3a proteins but not that of Foxo4 (Fig. 1a). Increased Foxo1 and Foxo3a protein abundance was not accompanied by corresponding changes in the expression of their transcripts (data not shown), suggestive of a post-transcriptional mechanism of control. Reduced IL-7 signaling resulted in lower amounts of p-Akt and diminished phosphorylation of Foxo1 and Foxo3a (Fig. 1b) that was inversely correlated with their overall protein abundance (Fig. 1a). Given that Akt has been shown to phosphorylate Foxo proteins and promote their degradation via ubiquitination, these results suggest that IL-7R signaling promotes Foxo protein degradation in pre-B cells via the PI(3)K-Akt pathway. Consistent with this inhibitory mechanism, attenuation of IL-7 signaling resulted in increased Foxo1 DNA binding activity, its nuclear accumulation (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b) and binding in vivo to enhancers (Erag1 and Erag2) in the Rag locus (Fig. 1c). As shown previously, attenuation of IL-7 signaling in Irf4,8-/-pre-B cells resulted in the robust induction of Rag gene expression (ref. and Fig. 1d) and importantly this was dependent on Foxo1 and Foxo3a as their knockdown in these cells via shRNAs impaired Rag gene activation (Supplementary Fig. 2a). We note that knockdown of Foxo1 or Foxo3a also resulted in a defect in the ability of Irf4,8-/- pre-B cells to undergo cell-cycle arrest upon the attenuation of IL-7 signaling (Supplementary Fig. 2b) and this was correlated with impaired induction of the gene encoding the CDK inhibitor p27 (ref. and data not shown). Gain-of-function experiments with Foxo1 and Foxo3a reinforced the conclusion that they are potent activators of Rag gene expression in pre-B cells (Supplementary Fig. 2c). It should be noted that increased expression of Foxo1 and Foxo3a resulted in the selective induction of Rag gene expression but not kappa germline transcription whereas the restoration of IRF-4 expression in these cells primarily induced kappa germline transcription (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Thus we propose that efficient pre-B cell differentiation is contingent on induction of Foxo transcription factors via attenuation of IL-7R and PI(3)K-Akt signaling and the upregulation of IRF-4 via the pre-BCR.
