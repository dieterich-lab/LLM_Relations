In further studies, we also observed recruitment of FEN-1 to DNA repair sites, which like DNA Ligase I interacts with PCNA during DNA replication and is implicated in long-patch BER. Remarkably, FEN-1 showed the same recruitment kinetics as DNA Ligase I although it has a completely different function in replication and repair. Likewise, the PBD of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is also necessary and sufficient for accumulation of Dnmt1 at repair sites. Taken together our results show that various PBD-containing proteins involved in the restoration of genetic and epigenetic information are recruited to replication as well as repair sites by PCNA.
