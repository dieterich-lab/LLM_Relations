To determine if this phenomenon is directly correlated with the abundance of H3K36me3, H3K36me3 and H3 were quantified in HeLa cells arrested at different stages of the cell cycle. The results show that H3K36me3 reaches a maximum abundance in early S phase, declines to a very low level by the end of S phase and G2/M, and begins to increase in abundance in G1, even though the amount of histone H3 is relatively constant throughout the cell cycle (Figures 4D and 4E). We also observed abundant hMSH6 foci and their partial (~80%) colocalization with H3K36me3 in G1 phase (Figure S1C). Together, these results suggest that H3K36me3 recruits hMutSalpha to chromatin in vivo before and during early S phase, which could increase the efficiency of MMR in actively replicating chromatin.
