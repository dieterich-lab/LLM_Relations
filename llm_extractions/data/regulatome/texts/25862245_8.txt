In this paper, we aimed to investigate Dock10 function by defining, for the first time, the specificity of the complete Dock10 protein for "classic" Rho GTPases, and studying its effects in human HeLa cells, using stable inducible expression. Our results show that Dock10 interacts with and activates Cdc42 and Rac1. Dock10 promotes a morphological transition from polygonal elongated to more rounded, non-polygonal cells. These cells develop abundant filopodia, frequently spread their area in contact with the substrate while retaining the non-elongated shape, and had increased ruffling activity. These results suggest that Dock10 is a GEF with broader specificity than its zizimin homologs, targeting Cdc42 but also Rac proteins.
