To further investigate a link between the binding of ATF2 to AARE sequences and the increase in histone H4 acetylation, we have chosen to study the AARE sequences of ASNS which have been described to bind ATF2 poorly even though it shares nucleotide sequence similarities with the CHOP and ATF3 AAREs (Figure 5A). According to these data, ATF2 is not essential in the specific amino acid pathway that leads to the induction of ASNS transcription (Figure 5D). ChIP experiments were performed in MEF deficient in ATF2 and in the corresponding wild type cells with a primer set covering the AARE of the ASNS gene (Figure 5E). As expected, the binding of ATF4 to this AARE was increased in response to amino acid starvation in both cell types. Most importantly, no significant binding of ATF2 to the ASNS AARE was detected in wild type cells while, in contrast to the results obtained with the CHOP and ATF3 AAREs the lack of ATF2 did not affect the increase in histone H4 acetylation in the vicinity of the AARE following leucine deprivation. These findings show that an ATF2-independent HAT activity is involved in the amino acid regulation of ASNS transcription.
