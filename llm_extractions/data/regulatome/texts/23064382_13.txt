One of the best-studied forms of activity-dependent structural plasticity involves the enlargement of spine heads, which is BDNF-dependent and correlated with enhanced AMPA receptor expression and increase in synaptic strength. Given that S478 phosphorylation of TrkB was crucial for BDNF-induced spine enlargement, we asked whether S478 phosphorylation is also involved in activity-dependent spine remodeling. To this end, we used photolysis of MNI-glutamate to examine activity-dependent spine enlargement of dissociated hippocampal neurons using time-lapse confocal microscopy. Uncaging glutamate has been used to induce NMDA receptor-dependent spine remodeling in both hippocampal slices and dissociated hippocampal neurons. In our study, dissociated hippocampal neurons were transfected with GFP, and selected spines were imaged at real time before and after glutamate uncaging. After a brief 405-nm laser stimulation, we observed a rapid increase in spine size, and the increase was absent without MNI-glutamate (Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating that the spine enlargement was triggered by the photolysis of MNI-glutamate instead of a nonspecific side effect of laser illumination. Next, we examined and compared the effect of glutamate uncaging on the increase in spine area between hippocampal neurons cultured from either TrkbWT/WT or TrkbS478A/S478A mice. Compared with that of control neurons, the magnitude of the increase in spine area after glutamate uncaging was significantly attenuated (P < 0.05) in the TrkbS478A neurons (Fig. 2c), supporting the notion that S478 phosphorylation of TrkB is involved in activity-dependent spine remodeling.
