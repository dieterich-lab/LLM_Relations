Microsequencing of purified p45PFK, a kinase previously implicated in circadian control in mammals , demonstrates that it corresponds to CK2alpha (Suppl. Fig.1). Interestingly, purified p45PFK phosphorylates BMAL1 and CLOCK in vitro (Suppl. Fig. 2). The CK2 holoenzyme is constituted by two copies of the catalytic (CK2alpha) and regulatory (CK2beta) subunits (alpha 2beta2). CK2alpha monomer also exists as an active form in vivo. To assess the role of CK2beta in modulating CK2alpha -mediated BMAL1 phosphorylation, we co-incubated the subunits in kinase assays. CK2alpha alone phosphorylated GST-BMAL1, whereas CK2beta inhibited BMAL1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that CK2alpha monomer phosphorylates BMAL1.
