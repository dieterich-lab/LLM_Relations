After COPII vesicles bud from the ER, Sar1p is released from vesicles when GTP is hydrolyzed, but the inner and outer shells of the coat are largely retained (Fig S1). To define the events that occur after TRAPPI binds to Sec23p, we immobilized TRAPPI on beads and asked when COPII vesicles lose their ability to bind. For these studies, the binding of pro-alpha-factor-containing vesicles formed with cytosol, was considered to be 100% (Fig. 1a, bar 1). We observed that vesicles formed in the presence of Golgi lost their ability to bind TRAPPI (Fig. 1a, bar 2). Since the binding of vesicles to TRAPPI is mediated by the COPII coat, this experiment suggests that COPII vesicles lose their ability to bind TRAPPI because the Golgi contains a factor that either releases or modifies the coat. To determine if vesicles must tether to the Golgi to lose their ability to bind to TRAPPI, we formed vesicles with bet3-1 mutant fractions. The bet3-1 mutant, which harbors a mutation in the Bet3p subunit of TRAPPI, is defective in vesicle tethering. The defect in this mutant is partially complemented in vitro by the addition of purified recombinant TRAPPI (Fig. S2a). Vesicles formed from bet3-1 donor cells and cytosol, with or without Golgi, bound equally well to the TRAPPI-containing beads (Fig. 1a, last two bars). These findings suggest that the vesicles must tether to the Golgi to lose their ability to bind to TRAPPI.
