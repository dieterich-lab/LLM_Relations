In contrast to results reported by Sharma et al., we observed that the loss of m5C2870 in helix 89 of 25S rRNA had no effect on ribosome synthesis as shown by using the Nop2DB mutant in complementation assays. We conclude that the activity of the Nop2 RNA:m5C-MTase is not required for the function of Nop2 in pre-rRNA processing. These results also confirm that Nop2 belongs to the large family of pre-ribosomal protein and possesses two related functions: an rRNA modification activity and an essential role in pre-rRNA cleavage(s). These results corroborate the concept of quality control of ribosome synthesis by several modification enzymes. This notion was previously developed for Dim1p, then for Emg1 as well as for Bud23. These rRNA-MTases bind to pre-rRNA in the nucleolus at an early stage in ribosome synthesis and allow coordinated cleavages in pre-rRNA while present in the nucleolus. Similarly, when Nop2p is bound to pre-rRNA, the processing machinery may identify this interaction allowing cleavage at sites C1/C2 to proceed; otherwise, processing is blocked. The strong growth phenotype that we have observed for p120 expressing yeast is probably related to the inability of the yeast pre-RNA processing machinery to use p120 instead of Nop2, possibly causing a delay in the 25S rRNA synthesis and thereby the observed slow growth phenotype.
