To study the time course of recruitment of USP45 to sites of laser-induced DNA damage, we stably expressed GFPNLS-USP45 in U2OS cells with a nuclear localisation signal (NLS) on the GFP moiety to ensure nuclear localisation. We induced tracks of DNA damage as described above and monitored GFP fluorescence at sites of laser-induced micro-irradiation after BrdU treatment. This experiment confirmed that GFPNLS-USP45, but not isolated GFPNLS, formed sub-nuclear stripes along the laser tracks under all conditions employed. The recruitment of USP45 to these stripes was rapid, occurring within 30 s and declining thereafter to near basal levels within 5 min (Fig9). We also observed that in contrast to wild-type USP45, the catalytically inactive mutant GFPNLS-USP45 [Cys199Ala] when stably expressed in U2OS cells, was not recruited to laser stripes (Fig9). Moreover, GFPNLS-[USP45 residues 62-end] that lacks the ERCC1-binding motif, was still transiently recruited to laser-induced sites of DNA damage, whereas the ERCC1-binding GFPNLS-[USP45 residues 1-62] fragment was not recruited to sites of DNA damage (Supplementary Fig S16A). To confirm that ERCC1 was not required for recruitment of USP45 to sites of DNA damage, we show that in ERCC1 knockout MEFs, endogenous USP45 is normally recruited to sites of damage (Supplementary Fig S16B and C).
