To determine if HJURP is required for cell cycle dependent incorporation of CENP-A into centromeric nucleosomes after mitotic exit into G1, as opposed to HJURP acting only to maintain already assembled CENP-A nucleosomes, loading of newly synthesized CENP-A was tested during the first cell cycle after depletion of HJURP by siRNA. We have previously developed a pulse-chase labeling technique by fusing a SNAP tag to CENP-A. Cell lines in which a CENP-A-SNAP fusion protein is localized to centromeres were partially synchronized with a first thymidine arrest and then released, transfected with siRNA to HJURP or to a control (GAPD), and then arrested at the next G1/S boundary (Fig. 5A). Under these conditions, HJURP is reduced to below 10% of initial levels (data not shown). Visualization of all existing CENP-A-SNAP was blocked with non-fluorescent benzylguanine Newly synthesized CENP-A-SNAP was labeled with TMR-Star (the fluorescent benzyl guanine) during the subsequent G2 phase and assembly of new labeled CENP-A nucleosomes was then assessed at the subsequent G1/S boundary. Post-mitotic loading of new CENP-A into centromeres was severely diminished in cells with reduced HJURP levels compared with the GAPD siRNA treated control cells where TMR-Star labeled CENP-A-SNAP was easily apparent (Fig. 5B,C).
