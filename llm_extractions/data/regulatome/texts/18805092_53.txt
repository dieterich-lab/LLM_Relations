Cul5ctd-Rbx1 crystals were grown by microseeding 4degreesC hanging drops 1:1 with ~2% PEG3350, 0.1M HEPES, 0.2M L-Pro, pH 8.0, in P212121 with a=63.0, b=65.5, c=141.1 and one complex per au, and frozen in 5% PEG3350, 0.1M HEPES, 0.2M L-Pro, 8% glycerol, 8% ethylene glycol, 8% sucrose, pH 8.0. NEDD8~Cul5ctd-Rbx1 crystals were grown by microseeding 4degreesC hanging drops 1:1 with ~19% PEG3350, 275mM (NH4)2PO4, 5mM DTT, in P212121 with a=88.2, b=122.4, c=128.6 and two complexes per au, and frozen in 19% PEG3350, 250mM (NH4)2PO4, 10mM DTT, 8% glycerol, 8% ethylene glycol, 8% sucrose. Data were processed with HKL2000. SAD phases for NEDD8~Cul5ctd-Rbx1 were obtained with SOLVE with 24 of 36 Ses, with hand determination/density modification by RESOLVE. Initial maps showed continuous density for NEDD8, Cul5ctd, and Rbx1 19-35. Rbx1's RINGs were built by bootstrapping in O. Anomalous data collected at 1.283 Aa showed zincs and confirmed RING positions. Cul5ctd-Rbx1 structure was determined by molecular replacement using PHASER with 4HB, alpha/beta, and WHB subdomains from NEDD8~Cul5ctd-Rbx1. SeMet anomolous difference fourier maps from data collected at 0.98Aa confirm SeMet and zinc positions. Models were refined with CNS and contain: Cul5ctd-Rbx1 - Cul5 401-517 and 520-780, and Rbx1 19-63 and 67-108; NEDD8~Cul5ctd-Rbx11 - all NEDD8 residues, Cul5 401-515 and 520-780, and Rbx1 20-105; NEDD8~Cul5ctd-Rbx12 - all NEDD8 residues, Cul5 401-517 and 520-780, and Rbx1 19-50 and 53-105, with 58-60, 63-65, 71, 78, 93-94 built into patchy density and thus assigned zero occupancy. Details are in Supplementary Table 1. We presume the Rfree for NEDD8~Cul5ctd-Rbx1 reflects high RING mobility.
