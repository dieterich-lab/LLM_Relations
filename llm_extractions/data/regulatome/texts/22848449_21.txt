In the absence of ubiquitinated RIP1 there is no stimulus-specific interaction of NEMO and RIP1. Our model that NEMO prevents cell death by interacting with ubiquitinated RIP1 predicts that NEMO should be unable to prevent programmed necrosis when RIP1 is not ubiquitinated. To test this prediction, we treated NEMO-null/IkappaBalphaSR cells and NEMO-WT/IkappaBalphaSR cells with the SMAC mimetic to prevent ubiquitination of RIP1. As predicted, NEMO-null/IkappaBalphaSR and NEMO-WT/IkappaBalphaSR cells display the same sensitivity to TNF-induced programmed necrosis after treatment with SMAC mimetic (Figure 4A and 4B). We confirmed that all programmed necrosis induced by the SMAC mimetic in these cells was blocked by Necrostatin-1 (Figure 4B). Therefore, if there are no ubiquitin chains on RIP1, for instance in cells treated with a combination of TNF and SMAC mimetic to prevent ubiquitination, NEMO does not prevent necrosis. In contrast, NEMO prevented necrosis when the SMAC mimetic is absent suggesting that the ubiquitination machinery for RIP1 must be intact in order for NEMO to "restrain" RIP1 from triggering programmed necrosis.
