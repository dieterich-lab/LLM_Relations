The expression of a truncated Hox protein lacking a homeodomain is not unique to Hoxa1. For example, an alternatively spliced transcript for Hoxa9 has been detected by RT-PCR. The alternative splicing causes a frameshift, resulting in the translation of a truncated protein that lacks the homeodomain. Differentially spliced transcripts resulting in Hox proteins that lack homeodomains have also been described for human HOXA1, murine Hoxb6, human HOXB6, and Xenopus XlHbox2. The functions of these truncated Hox proteins that lack homeodomains have not been studied in depth. However, the truncated HOXB6 protein is expressed in undifferentiated keratinocytes and the full-length protein is induced by differentiation. Moreover, full-length HOXB6 is localized to the nucleus, while the truncated HOXB6 protein is cytoplasmic. The same protein localization patterns have been described for HoxA9. Additionally, the Drosophila melanogaster homothorax (hth) gene also encodes two protein isoforms, one that contains the homeodomain and another truncated protein that does not. These two proteins carry out distinct functions during development. Both proteins are capable of forming functional hth/Exd complexes (vertebrate ortholog of Meis1/Pbx complex), but with putative distinct transcriptional properties. These data indicate that truncated Hox proteins that lack homeodomains may function in regulating differentiation. Previously Hoxa1-993 was shown to be required for proper differentiation of ES cells and F9 cells. In this study, we sought to determine the role of Hoxa1-399 in the differentiation of F9 stem cells induced by RA.
