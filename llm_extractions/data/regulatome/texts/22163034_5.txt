In human cells, Dicer does not act alone, but in cooperation with protein partners, such as members of the AGO family, HIV-1 TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP), a protein activator of PKR (PACT) and possibly other accessory proteins. The contribution of Dicer protein partners to either the efficiency or the specificity of miRNA biogenesis is important but is still unclear and poorly understood. It has been shown that Dicer, AGO2 and TRBP are necessary components in the formation of the RISC-loading complex (RLC) and the effective production of short RNAs. In one study, the depletion of TRBP affected pre-miRNA processing in vitro, but it had no effect on the accumulation of pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs in cells. In another study, the knockdown of TRBP in human cells was shown to result in lower levels of miRNAs, which suggested that the lack of TRBP decreased Dicer stability. A similar destabilization of Dicer resulting from an impairment of TRBP was reported in the case of human carcinomas, in which frameshift mutations in the TRBP gene caused defects in the processing of miRNA precursors. TRBP and PACT interact with each other and associate with Dicer to facilitate the cleavage of dsRNA. The loss of PACT expression was also reported to influence the biogenesis of miRNAs.
