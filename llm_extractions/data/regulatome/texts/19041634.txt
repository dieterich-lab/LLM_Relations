SUMOylation of RORalpha potentiates transcriptional activation function.  SUMOylation regulates a variety of cellular processes, including control of transcriptional activities of nuclear receptors. Here, we present SUMOylation of orphan nuclear receptor, RORalpha by both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2. SUMOylation of RORalpha occurred on the 240th lysine residue at the hinge region of human protein. PIAS family members, PIASxalpha, PIAS3, and PIASy, increased SUMOylation of RORalpha, whereas SENP2 specifically removed SUMO from RORalpha. SUMOylation-defective mutant form of RORalpha exhibited decreased transcriptional activity on RORalpha-responsive promoters indicating that SUMOylation may positively regulate transcriptional function of RORalpha.
