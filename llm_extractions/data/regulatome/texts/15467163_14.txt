NO is mainly synthesized in living organisms by the action of a group of enzymes called NOSs which convert the amino acid L-arginine into NO and another amino acid, L-citrulline. Oxygen is required and the NOSs contain four cofactors: FAD, FMN, tetrahydrobiopterin, and haem; the haem center has spectral properties resembling those of cytochrome P450. There are three types of NOSs. Two are constitutive (named cNOS) and one is inducible by cytokines and endotoxins (named iNOS). There are two subtypes of cNOS: one was initially detected in the vascular endothelium and named eNOS and the other is present in the central and peripheral nervous systems and named nNOS. The nNOS and iNOS are predominantly soluble enzymes whereas eNOS is more than 90% particulate. The nNOS and eNOS are Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzymes.
