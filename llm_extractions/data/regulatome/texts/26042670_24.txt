Our results strongly suggest that in the absence of the XPC SUMOylation, the damage handover from UV-DDB to XPC is compromised, so that UV-DDB bound to a DNA lesion blocks the following NER process (Fig. 4a). Although the XPC 3KR-expressing cells showed only a partial defect in removing 6-4PPs, one may assume that more profound effects may have been observed with repair of CPDs. In our transformed cell lines, however, CPDs were poorly repaired even with the expression of XPC WT, so that the difference from XPC 3KR was unclear. This is likely because the parental XPC-deficient cell line (XP4PASV) was immortalized with SV40, by which the p53 tumor suppressor was inactivated and thereby the expression levels of DDB2 were reduced. Nevertheless, the mutant XPC protein lacking the three SUMOylation sites is normally recruited to the sites with a UV-induced photolesion, and immobilized there in a UV-DDB-dependent manner (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S6). This suggests formation of a stable ternary complex containing XPC, UV-DDB and DNA, although we have not succeeded in capturing such a complex biochemically. In this situation, recruitment of the downstream NER factors, TFIIH and XPA, are compromised significantly (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. S2). Biochemical and structural studies have revealed that to induce productive dual incisions by NER, XPC must interact with the undamaged DNA strand and then load the XPD helicase in TFIIH onto the damaged strand immediately 5' to the lesion. Since UV-DDB directly interacts with the two affected bases comprising a photolesion, it is conceivable that such persistence of UV-DDB would prevent TFIIH (and more downstream factors like XPA) from access to the lesion. It remains to be understood how SUMOylation of XPC could promote dissolution of the stalled damage recognition complexes. Since UV-induced ubiquitination of XPC is impaired by the 3KR mutations, the SUMO moiety may somehow affect activation of the CUL4 ubiquitin ligase associated with UV-DDB.
