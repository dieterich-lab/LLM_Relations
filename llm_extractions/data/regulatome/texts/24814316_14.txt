MET recruits binding partners via key pY residues within its cytoplasmic domain (Figure 2F). To test whether the TNS4 SH2 domain directly interacts with MET, and to map the MET pY residue(s) required for TNS4 association (Figure S2D), we employed an in vitro ELISA binding assay. Biotinylated MET phosphopeptides encompassing the juxtamembrane Y1003, the kinase domain Y1234-Y1235 (in combination), Y1313, the docking-site Y1349 and Y1356 (separately or in combination in one peptide), and Y1365 were tested for their ability to interact with recombinant GST-TNS4-SH2-PTB. MET peptides containing Y1003 and Y1365 demonstrated only residual binding to GST-TNS4-SH2-PTB. MET peptides encompassing Y1234-Y1235 and Y1349 exhibited intermediate binding, whereas peptides containing Y1313, Y1356, and the combination of Y1349 and Y1356 presented the strongest interaction with GST-TNS4-SH2-PTB (Figures 2F and 2G). We next compared a consensus pY recognition sequence reported for TNS4 SH2 domain binding with the MET phosphopeptide sequences and with a previously reported sequence of DLC-1 that also binds TNS4 SH2 domain. The results of our binding assays, i.e., the interaction affinity between MET and TNS4, correlated with the degree of sequence homology between the MET phosphopeptides and the consensus pY recognition motif reported for TNS4 SH2 domain (Figure 2H).
