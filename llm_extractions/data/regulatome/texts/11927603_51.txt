Finally, if p115 is a bona fide catalyst for His-GOS-28-GST-syntaxin-5 binding, then it should not be consumed by the reaction. Thus, very low substoichiometric levels of p115 should stimulate the reaction. Hence, His-GOS-28-GST-syntaxin-5 binding was conducted with a p115 concentration three orders of magnitude lower than the SNARE concentration. To detect any effect, the incubation time was increased to 4 h. Even at levels below detection by immunoblot, p115 catalyzed the formation of His-GOS-28-GST-syntaxin-5 complexes (Fig. 8 C). His-GOS-28 was incorporated into the complex in amounts that were at least 20-fold greater than the total amount of p115 present. Kinetic analysis of His-GOS-28-GST-syntaxin-5 binding revealed that this substoichiometric level of p115 greatly enhanced the initial rate of GOS-28-syntaxin-5 binding (Fig. 8 D). This suggests that p115 catalyzes SNARE assembly.
