Past studies have shown that incorporation of histones into promoter nucleosome control gene expression in response to appropriate physiological signals. We demonstrated that H2ac interacts with the truncated ERalpha lacking the DNA binding domain, and that H2ac and ERalpha directly interacted in response to E2 stimulation. In our H2ac mutant experiment, immunoprecipitation analysis also showed that the binding of the mutant to ERalpha is greatly diminished. These results demonstrated that H2ac directly interacts with activated ERalpha in a DNA-independent manner. Further, truncated ERalpha lacking the DNA binding domain competed with wild-type ERalpha for binding to H2ac and interfered with E2-dependent gene activation. Compared with E2-stimulated MCF-7 cells, reduced levels of H2ac were found to be associated with BCL2 and c-MYC chromatin in E2-treated cells overexpressing the truncated form of ERalpha. These results clearly suggested that the DNA-binding domain of ERalpha is important for binding of the ERalpha-H2a complex to various genes.
