If Rab33B is a target of OATL1 during autophagosomal maturation in vivo, Rab33B should also affect autophagosomal maturation. As expected, expression of FLAG-tagged Rab33B (FLAG-Rab33B) or Rab33B-QL (i.e., a GTPase-deficient mutant; FLAG-Rab33B-QL) increased both the LC3-II level (Fig. 9 A) and the number of LC3-positive dots in the cytoplasm (Fig. 9 B) even under replenished conditions. Because monomeric RFP-Rab33B-TN (a constitutively negative form mutant) did not increase LC3-II under nutrient-rich or starved conditions, Rab33B-TN is unlikely to affect autophagosomal maturation. In contrast to the OATL1-expressing cells (Fig. 6 A), most of the LC3-positive dots in the cytoplasm of FLAG-Rab33-QL-expressing cells appeared to be colocalized with Lamp-1, especially when viewed under low magnification (Fig. 9 C, left). However, close inspection of the immunostaining under high magnification revealed that most of the LC3-positive dots did not completely overlap with the Lamp-1-positive dots (Fig. 9 C, right), in contrast to their appearance in the bafilomycin A1-treated cells (Fig. 6 B). Based on these findings, together with the fact that Rab33B is a target of OATL1, we speculate that the LC3-positive autophagosomes in Rab33B-QL-expressing cells are not efficiently fused with lysosomes.
