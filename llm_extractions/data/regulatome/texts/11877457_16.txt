Our results suggest that AAK1 corresponds to the endogenous kinase activity responsible for phosphorylation of mu2. Indeed, when purified recombinant AAK1 was added to immunoisolated AP2 lacking associated kinase activity (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) and devoid of AAK1 (as revealed by Western blotting, unpublished data), mu2 was very efficiently phosphorylated (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). This demonstrates that the mu2 subunit of immobilized AP2 is a substrate for recombinant AAK1. We next compared the endogenous mu2 kinase activity associated with HAP-purified AP2 with the activity of recombinant AAK1 toward immunoisolated AP2 for their sensitivity to various kinase inhibitors. Phosphorylation of mu2 by both the endogenous kinase and purified AAK1 was abolished by N-ethylmaleimide treatment (Fig. 3 A, lane 3, NEM) and was inhibited in the presence of staurosporine, a broad spectrum inhibitor of PKC (lane 4). Additionally, the PKA-specific inhibitor KT5720 partially inhibited both endogenous kinase activity and that of purified recombinant AAK1 (Fig. 3 A, lane 7). None of the other kinase inhibitors with specificity for PKG, CaM kinase, or CKII (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5, 6, and 9, respectively), nor a more specific PKC inhibitor (lane 8) had any effect when present at concentrations known to selectively inhibit their target kinases. Thus, we were unable to distinguish AAK1 activity from that of the endogenous mu2-phosphorylating activity.
