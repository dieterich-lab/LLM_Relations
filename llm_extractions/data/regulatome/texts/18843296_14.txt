To probe for direct interactions between the SNARE proteins and the COPII coat subunits, we expressed portions of the cytosolic domains of membrin and syntaxin 5 fused to the N terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST), then immobilized the fusion proteins on glutathione sepharose beads and probed for binding to Sec24c. Purified Sec24c was diluted with E. coli lysate proteins, and the specificity of the interactions was assessed by the enrichment of the coat protein from the input mixture (Figure 1B and 1D).
