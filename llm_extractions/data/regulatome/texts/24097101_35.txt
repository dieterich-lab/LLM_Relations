Nine representative candidate genes, based on their known functions in inflammation, were selected for validation by PCR with independent biological samples. This group included Jmjd3 (two independent binding sites), Ccl5, Ezr, Ifih1, Irf7, Uba7, Il-6, and Pim1. The ChIP-PCR confirmed the specific binding of Stat1 and/or Stat3 for eight of the nine promoters analyzed (Fig. 2b); the exception was Tlr7. In particular, we confirmed that P-Stat1 and P-Stat3 bind to the Jmjd3 gene promoter; one of the sites originally identified as a P-Stat3 binding site actually binds both P-Stat1 and P-Stat3. These results demonstrate a subset of genes upregulated in inflammatory microglial cells, which includes known (Il-6) and novel, transcriptional targets of Stats (Jmjd3, Ccl5, Ezr, Ifih1, Irf7, Uba7, and Pim1). These data suggest that Stat1 and/or Stat3 are required to induce expression of the target genes coding for inflammatory proteins, which are important in inflammation.
