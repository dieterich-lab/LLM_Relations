It has been shown that PCSK9 promotes LDLR degradation in hepatocytes, and here we show that PCSK9 also promotes receptor degradation in lymphocytes (Fig. 1A). Both of these cell lines require ARH for LDLR-mediated endocytosis of LDL. In contrast, ARH is not required for LDLR-mediated endocytosis in fibroblasts. The addition of PCSK9 to the medium of transformed fibroblasts failed to stimulate LDLR degradation (Fig. 1). Hepatocytes and lymphocytes, but not fibroblasts, require ARH for LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis . These findings, when taken together, suggested that ARH may be specifically required for PCSK9 action. Here we show that PCSK9 promotes LDLR degradation in several different primary cell lines of human fibroblasts, even cells that are deficient in ARH. Thus, ARH is not specifically required as the endocytic adaptor for PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation.
