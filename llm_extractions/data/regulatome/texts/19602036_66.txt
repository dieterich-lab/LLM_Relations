Because different interactions with MeCP2 and chromatin modifications were observed in different brain regions, we sought to determine if these correlated with the dissociation or association of chromatin-remodelling factors such as Brg1 or Brahma (Brm) (Fig. 8). Interaction of MeCP2 with Brm with respect to transcriptional silencing remains controversial. We used Brm antibody to coimmunoprecipitate MeCP2 protein from mouse whole brain. MeCP2 was not detected in Brm-precipitated samples relative to input (i.e. pre-precipitation samples) or supernatant (SN) controls (Fig. 8A). Likewise, when MeCP2 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation, the Brm band was not detected on Western blots, relative to input or SN controls. MeCP2 interacts with the transcriptional repressor mSin3A for transcriptional silencing. As a control, the MeCP2 antibody was able to successfully pull down the mSin3A protein (Fig. 8A). Surprisingly, Brg1 (another component of the ATPase subunits of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex) was associated with MeCP2 protein (Fig. 8A) as both full-length Brg1 and its isoforms, although the isoforms showed weaker interactions. Indeed, Western blots performed with the same Brg1 antibody as that used in the coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed Brg1 expression in different cells and mouse brain (Fig. 8B). Taken together, these results indicate that the MeCP2 repressor complex is associated with Brg1 rather than Brm, possibly because of a higher binding affinity for Brg1.
