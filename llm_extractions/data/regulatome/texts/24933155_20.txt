The C-terminal region of ARHGAP22 contains CC domain similar to FilGAP and has FLNa-binding motif. However, ARHGAP22 does not bind to FLNa in vitro and in vivo (Figure 2B and C). The high-affinity binding of FilGAP to FLNa is dependent on the dimerization of FilGAP. Therefore, we investigated if ARHGAP22 can dimerize in vivo. To investigate whether ARHGAP22 can dimerize in cells similar to FilGAP, we transfected HEK cells with HA-ARHGAP22 and FLAG-ARHGAP22. HA-ARHGAP22 was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using anti-HA agarose. The immunoprecipitate was separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for the presence of FLAG- and HA-ARHGAP22 (Figure 2D). Although HA-ARHGAP22 was detectable in the immunoprecipitate as expected, little FLAG-ARHGAP22 was included in the HA-ARHGAP22 immunoprecipitate. On the other hand, FLAG-FilGAP was readily detectable in the HA-FilGAP immunoprecipitate, which was precipitated from co-transfected HEK cells. These results suggest that FilGAP can oligomerize in vivo, but ARHGAP22 does not.
