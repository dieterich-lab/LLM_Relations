Previously we reported the contribution of both Stat1 and Stat3 in controlling IL-13-stimulated 15-LO expression in human monocytes by using transcription factor decoy technology. To examine the involvement of Stat1 and Stat3 for other M2 gene expression in alternatively activated monocytes/macrophages by IL-13, we next checked the effect of both Stat1 and Stat3 decoy ODN treatment in regulating IL-13-induced MAO-A gene expression. Results from our Western blot analysis indicate that both Stat1 and Stat3 decoy ODNs significantly down-regulated the IL-13-mediated induction of MAO-A protein expression (*p<0.002) (Fig. 7A and 7B, upper panels), whereas transfection of cells with either Stat1 or Stat3 mismatched ODNs (used as controls) essentially had no effect on IL-13-stimulated MAO-A protein expression (Fig. 7A and 7B, upper panels). These results suggest that in addition to 15-LO, Stat1 and Stat3 transcription factors are also required for the expression of other alternative state (M2) genes like MAO-A in IL-13-stimulated monocytes/macrophages.
