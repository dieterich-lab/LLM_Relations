To directly test the hypothesis that Arc expression can interfere with BDNF signaling, we expressed Arc in SH-SY5Y-TrkB cells and examined TrkB signaling. Arc overexpression decreased the levels of BDNF-induced p-Akt, p-CaMKII, p-4EBP1, p-S6 (Figures 4B and S4B, lower panel quantitation), but not p-Erk or p-TrkB, identical to knockdown of PSD-95 (Figure 3C). Significantly, CN2097 restored the defective CaMKII, Akt, 4EBP1, and S6 signaling resulting from Arc overexpression to control levels (Figures 4B and S4B, lower panel quantitation), and disrupted the interaction between Arc and PSD-95, with a concomitant increase in BDNF-induced TrkB-PSD-95 association (Figure S4B, middle panel). In a different approach to increase Arc levels we expressed a dominant negative Ube3A (E6AP C833A) in the SH-SY5Y-TrkB cells. We also observed significantly reduced BDNF-induced p-Akt signaling when compared to SH-SY5Y-TrkB control cells (Figure S4C), which was rescued with an Arc-shRNA (Figure S4C).
