2muL of affinity-purified Get3 targeting complex was mixed with 1muL of microsomes (OD280=80) in 8 muL of insertion buffer with ATP regenerating system and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by crosslinking with 0.5mM disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (Pierce) at room temperature for 30 minutes. Crosslinking was quenched by incubation with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 for 5 minutes at room temperature. Prior to monitoring Sec22 release from Get3 by proteoliposomes (Fig. 2a), we added 0.3 mug of TA trap, to 1muL of proteoliposomes and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. In one instance (Fig. S1), membranes were substituted with miniGet1/2 and TA trap (0.1mug/muL) or mock trap (0.1 mug/muL), as described previously.
