The Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex binds to DSB ends and plays important roles in facilitating ATM activation and promoting end resection to initiate HR-mediated DSB repair. CtIP (CtBP-interacting protein), which is associated with MRN and BRCA1, is also a critical player in the regulation of HR. In mammalian cells, CtIP binds to MRN through Nbs1. Such interaction was also observed in fission yeast, where the FHA/BRCT domains of Nbs1 interact with the phospho-motifs at the CK2 sites on Ctp1, and this interaction is important for recruiting Ctp1 to DSB ends by Nbs1. In budding yeast, the CtIP homologue Sae2 exhibits endonuclease activities to cleave the ssDNA (single-strand DNA)/dsDNA (double-strand DNA) junctions and the sites close to DNA hairpin loops. Although the nuclease activity of CtIP itself was not identified, CtIP was found to promote the nuclease activity of MRN to process DSB ends in mammalian cells.
