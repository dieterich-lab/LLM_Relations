Dendritic architecture, the number and frequency of intersections and spines, is critical to the morphology and function of neuronal cells. Using a variation on the Scholl analysis, the number of spines and intersections was quantified as a function of distance from the soma (per 10mm). Despite some significant increases in dendritic complexity (Table S1), particularly for FLRT1 (0-10mm), Y3F-FLRT1 (0-30mm) and FLRT1/FGFR1 (0-40mm) expressing cells, there was no change in the radial profile of dendritic complexity with the peak remaining in the first 10mm and steadily declining with increased distance from the cell body (Figure 3C). The rather surprising results we observed when comparing FLRT1 only expression with Y3F-FLRT1/FGFR1 co-expression suggest that up-regulation of FGFR1 can counteract the effect of deregulating FLRT1 phosphorylation. Whilst suggestive of a bipartite mechanism, this remains unclear and further analysis will be required to resolve completely the functions of FLRT that are FGFR-dependent/independent.
