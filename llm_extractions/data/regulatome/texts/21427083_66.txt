There have been previous reports of miRNA mimics targeting gene promoters in human cells. The first report of a promoter-targeting miRNA, from Place et al., showed that introduction of exogenous miR-373 induced expression of two genes that contain promoter regions with complementarity to the miRNA. Subsequently, Kim et al. reported that miR-320 targets its own genomic location in cis and silences transcription of an adjacent gene, POLR3D through an AGO1-dependent mechanism. Our data differ significantly from these previous results. Because miR-320 targets its own genomic location, it inherently has full complementarity to its target sequence. We demonstrate that miRNAs do not require full complementarity to recognize their targets within gene promoters and silence transcription. We also show that gene silencing can be achieved by miRNAs that target gene promoters in trans and that a single miRNA can silence transcription of multiple genes. Finally, whereas miR-320 was reported to recruit AGO1 to its target, we find that miRNAs with incomplete complementarity to their targets require AGO2, suggesting the potential for different silencing mechanisms.
