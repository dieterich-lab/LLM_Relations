Yeast two-hybrid interaction studies in Drosophila identified the Ral effectors Sec5 and RalBP1/RLIP, and RalBP1/RLIP binds with known partner REPS1. Upstream of Ral, both fly Ras and fly Rap bind RalGEF in yeast two-hybrid assays, consistent with their identical core effector binding regions. However, in mammalian systems Ras and Rap1 are localized to mostly non-overlapping subcellular compartments, and it is expected that they encounter distinct sets of effectors. Overexpression studies with the two splice variants of the fly RalGEF suggest that one alternative isoform, differing in N-terminal sequence, harbors Ral-independent functions. This putative GEF-independent function of RalGEF may correspond to putative N-terminally encoded GEF-independent functions of mammalian RalGDS, where RalGDS is thought to scaffold PDK and Akt, thus potentiating Akt output in certain circumstances. Genetic analyses, mostly using ectopically expressed constructs, implicates the Rap1 small GTPase, rather than Ras, as a putative activator of RalGEF. However, these results are also consistent with Rap1 functioning in parallel, and illustrate the potential complexities of dominant-negative mutations as experimental tools for small GTPases, as well as the difficulties of analyzing the functions of essential genes in vivo. The Ras, Rap1 and Ral small GTPases act in multiple developmental events during Drosophila development, so there is ample opportunity to study their functions further.
