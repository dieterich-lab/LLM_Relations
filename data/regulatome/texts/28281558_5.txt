Human PEX19 consists of 299 amino acids with an intrinsically disordered N-terminal half that interacts with the membrane-bound docking protein PEX3 (refs) and PEX14 (ref.). The folded C-terminal domain (CTD) mediates binding to PMPs and harbours the CaaX box site for farnesylation (Fig. 1a). A crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment (comprising residues 161-283), referred to as CTDDeltaC below, showed that the PEX19 fold comprises four alpha-helices that exhibit a three-helical bundle domain and an additional N-terminal helix alpha1 protruding away from this bundle. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the CTDDeltaC fragment is capable of binding PMP peptides with micromolar affinity, while mutational analysis suggested that residues located in helix alpha1 contribute to cargo binding. However, the crystallized PEX19 fragment lacks the C-terminal 16 amino acids, which include the farnesylation site, and thus the structural impact of farnesylation and its role in the modulation of PMP binding remain unknown.
