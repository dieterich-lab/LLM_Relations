Our finding that UPF1 binds PTC-containing Gl mRNA more efficiently than it does its PTC-free counterpart is consistent with findings using S. cerevisiae and C. elegans that UPF1 selectively "marks" mRNAs that are targeted for NMD. However, it remained to be determined for mammals if the preferential binding of UPF1 to PTC-containing mRNA is attributable to UPF1 binding to CBP80. Thus, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pCMV-MYC or pCMV-MYC-UPF1(419-700), the pmCMV-Gl Ter test plasmid, and the phCMV-MUP reference plasmid. Nuclear lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-UPF1 or, as a control for nonspecific IP, NRS. Using samples in which a comparable amount of UPF1 had been immunoprecipitated (Figure 6B, upper; notably, anti-UPF1 does not immunoprecipitate MYC-UPF1(419-700)), RT-PCR demonstrated that MYC-UPF1(419-700) expression decreased the efficiency of NMD by increasing the level of Gl Ter mRNA ~11-fold prior to IP (Figure 6B, middle). Considering this decrease, MYC-UPF1(419-700) expression was accompanied by a ~6-fold decrease in the level of UPF1-bound Gl Ter mRNA (Figure 6B, middle).
