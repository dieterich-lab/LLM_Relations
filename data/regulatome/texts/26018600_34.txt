The contact pathway of coagulation is initiated by activation of factor XII (fXII) in a process that also involves high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) and plasma prekallikrein (PK). Contact of blood with an artificial surface leads to a change in the conformation of fXII, resulting in the generation of small amounts of active factor XII (fXIIa). This enzyme then activates PK to kallikrein. Further reciprocal activation of fXII by kallikrein, and PK by fXIIa, results in a positive feedback loop. The fXIIa that is generated then activates its downstream substrate, fXI, to fXIa (Figure 1). Limited proteolysis of fIX to fIXa by fXIa then allows for formation of the "intrinsic tenase" complex (i.e., the cell-surface complex of fIXa and fVIIIa), which in turn activates fX to fXa. The final common pathway of blood clotting then leads to thrombin generation and a blood clot.
