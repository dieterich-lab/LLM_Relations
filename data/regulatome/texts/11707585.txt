Fringe modulation of Jagged1-induced Notch signaling requires the action of beta 4galactosyltransferase-1.  Fringe modulates Notch signaling resulting in the establishment of compartmental boundaries in developing organisms. Fringe is a beta 3N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (beta 3GlcNAcT) that transfers GlcNAc to O-fucose in epidermal growth factor-like repeats of Notch. Here we use five different Chinese hamster ovary cell glycosylation mutants to identify a key aspect of the mechanism of fringe action. Although the beta 3GlcNAcT activity of manic or lunatic fringe is shown to be necessary for inhibition of Jagged1-induced Notch signaling in a coculture assay, it is not sufficient. Fringe fails to inhibit Notch signaling if the disaccharide generated by fringe action, GlcNAc beta 3Fuc, is not elongated. The trisaccharide, Gal beta 4GlcNAc beta 3Fuc, is the minimal O-fucose glycan to support fringe modulation of Notch signaling. Of six beta 4galactosyltransferases (beta 4GalT) in Chinese hamster ovary cells, only beta 4GalT-1 is required to add Gal to GlcNAc beta 3Fuc, identifying beta 4GalT-1 as a new modulator of Notch signaling.
