We further observed that in the presence of DNA, STING mostly localized with the early endosome marker protein EEA1 and recycling endosome marker transferrin receptor (TFR; Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 6). TBK1 has also been demonstrated to associate with Sec5, a component of the excocyst 8 subunit complex that facilitates vesicular transport processes. After intracellular DNA stimulation, STING was found to strongly colocalize with Sec5, which has also been demonstrated to associate in perinuclear endosome compartments (Fig. 4g). The RALB and Sec5 pathway has been previously shown to be required for efficient Sendai-virus-mediated type I IFN production. However, our data here indicates that STING and TBK1 complexes may traffic to endosome compartments to associate with Sec5/exocyst components and facilitate the production of type I IFN in response to intracellular DNA. To evaluate whether Sec5 also modulates the production of IFNbeta in response to ISD, we suppressed Sec5 production in normal MEFs using RNA interference (RNAi). This study indicated that in the absence of Sec5, ISD-mediated IFN production was significantly impaired (Fig. 4h, i). A similar effect was observed after knockdown of Trapb (also known as Ssr2) and Sec61b, components of the TRAP complex (Fig. 4h, i and Supplementary Fig. 8). Our data thus indicates that intracellular DNA may induce STING to complex with TBK1 and traffic to Sec5-containing endosome compartments--events that facilitate the production of type I IFN.
