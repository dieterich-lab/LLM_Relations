Previous Arc reporter gene studies by Kuhl and colleagues identified two serum response elements (SREs) positioned at ~0.9 and ~1.5 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site of the Arc gene. However, their requirement to induce transcription was inconclusive. More recent work by the Bito and Finkbeiner laboratories uncovered regulatory elements in the Arc promoter region that are essential for activity-dependent transcriptional regulation (Fig. 2). Using a DNaseI hypersensitivity assay, Pintchovski and colleagues applied an unbiased approach to look for open chromatin regions, structures assumed requisite for active translation. This approach is beneficial as it overcomes the haunting concern associated with reporter gene assays where the DNA may not be fully chromatinized and, thus, may not reflect the physiological conditions of the gene. This study identified two novel enhancer elements located ~6.5 and ~1.4 kb upstream of the Arc TSS and multiple highly conserved regions containing putative binding sites for factors associated with plasticity, such as the nuclear factor of activated T cells, nuclear factor kB and myocyte-specific enhancement factor 2 (MEF2). The proximal enhancer region harbors two conserved "Zeste-like" elements that respond to synaptic activity and BDNF and convey transcriptional responses in an NMDAR-, PKA- and ERK-dependent fashion. The distal enhancer bears a functional and highly conserved SRE that binds serum response factor (SRF) to allow regulation of Arc upon stimulation, including synaptic activity, BDNF and forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase that generates cAMP (Fig. 2).
