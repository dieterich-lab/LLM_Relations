In vitro kinase assays and western blots with phospho-specific antibodies were used to further clarify PIKK roles in phosphorylating specific RPA32 residues. In cells treated with CPT, CDK phosphorylation of RPA32 Ser23 and Ser29 primes Thr21, Ser4 and Ser8 phosphorylation by DNA-PK. We therefore, incubated RPA32 with DNA-PK alone and in combination with CDK. RPA32 Ser4/Ser8 and Thr21 were phosphorylated by DNA-PK (Figure 2A-C), but not CDK, although the addition of CDK significantly enhanced phosphorylation of Thr21, consistent with in vivo results of Anantha et al.. CDK also slightly enhanced phosphorylation of Ser4/Ser8 (Figure 2A), consistent with in vitro results of Pan et al.. Ser4/Ser8 are not consensus PIKK target sequences, yet previous studies implicated DNA-PK in Ser4/Ser8 phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo; the data in Figure 2A is the first direct evidence, using phospho-specific antibodies, demonstrating DNA-PK targets Ser4/Se8 in vitro. DNA-PK also phosphorylated Ser33 (Figure 2A-C, most clearly seen in Figure 2C), but was far less efficient compared with DNA-PK phosphorylation of Ser4/Ser8 and Thr21 (Figure 2B). CDK phosphorylates Ser23 and Ser29 in vivo, and based on these previous results, our in vitro results, shown as slower migrating species on western blots probed with antibodies to native RPA32, most likely represent phosphorylation at Ser23 and Ser29 (Figure 2A). Interestingly, ATM phosphorylated Ser4/Ser8, but not Thr21, and ATM showed minimal activity toward Ser33 (Figure 2C). Controls confirmed that these reactions are ATP-dependent (Figure 2A and C, bottom panels).
