Requirements for processing of MTB bacilli for presentation of MTB Ag 85B. Macrophages were pulsed with HK MTB for 20 min, chased for 10 min at 37degreesC, and fixed. BB7 T hybridoma cells were used to detect Ag 85B(241-256)-I-Ab complexes. Supernatants were assessed for IL-2 content using a CTLL-2 proliferation assay that was monitored with Alamar blue, an indicator dye. (A) Effects of cytochalasin D (10 mug/ml) and chloroquine (100 muM) on Ag processing. (B) Comparison of processing of HK MTB by B6D2 and H2-DM-/- macrophages. Data points are means of triplicate samples +/- SD.
