Next, we analyzed the correlations between Upf1-interacting factors and NMD-inducing features: the upstream open reading frames (uORFs), introns downstream of translation termination codon, alternative splicing variants that harbors nonsense codons or frameshifts and selenocysteine incorporation codons (Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table S2). Transcripts commonly upregulated by at least 1.5-fold (Figure 5C) were analyzed. The results revealed that (i) there was no significant correlation between different Upf1-interacting factors and the NMD-inducing features and (ii) half of the transcripts in each category (SMG5&Upf1, SMG7&Upf1 and PNRC2&Upf1) contained uORF, which is an NMD-inducing feature.
