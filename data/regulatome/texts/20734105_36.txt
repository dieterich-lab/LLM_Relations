Both MK2 and MK5 reside predominantly in the nucleus of untreated cells. However, we have previously shown that PKA does not interact with nor phosphorylate MK2. Moreover, we found that forskolin did not induce nuclear export of the EGFP-MK2 fusion protein (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, Ser-115 in MK5 is encompassed in the motif RISQ, while the corresponding sequence in MK2 and MK3 is RIQ, lacking an equivalent of Ser-115 (Fig. 5b). To evaluate the importance of this Ser-115 in PKA-induced nuclear export of MK5, we reasoned that a MK2 mutant with an insertion of Asp as a phosphomimicking Ser-115 in the RIQ motif (= MK2insD) may behave identically to MK5 S115D, i.e. with both nuclear and cytoplasmic localizations in untreated cells. Contrary to MK5 S115D, the EGFP-MK2insD mutant remained exclusively in the nucleus of HeLa cells (Fig. 5c) and HEK293 cells (results not shown). Alignment of human and mouse MK5, MK2, and MK3 revealed differences in residues C-terminal to Ser-115 (Fig. 5b). To examine the possible contribution of these residues in PKA-triggered nuclear export, we constructed chimeric MK2 containing the wild-type MK5, and MK5 S115D sequences, to generate the fusion proteins EGFP-MK2/mk5 and EGFP-MK2/mk5 S115D, respectively. EGFP-MK2/mk5 S115D behaved as EGFP-MK5 S115D because it was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of untreated cells (Fig. 5d). Surprisingly, EGFP-MK2/mk5 was found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, but was most obvious in the cytoplasm. However, forskolin treatment caused complete nuclear exclusion of EGFP-MK2/mk5 (Fig. 5d). Taken together, these results indicate that Ser-115 is necessary but not sufficient to control subcellular distribution of MK5 in response to an activated PKA pathway. Amino acids C-terminal to Ser-115 also contribute to PKA-regulated subcellular distribution of MK5.
