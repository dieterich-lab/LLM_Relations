Since natural tiRNA preparations are contaminated with ribosomal and mRNA fragments, we compared the activity of synthetic 5'-end phosphorylated 5'-tiRNAs (5'-tiRNAs) and unphosphorylated 3'-tiRNAs (3'-tiRNAs) in this in vitro translation assay (Figure 1B). Although several tiRNAs significantly inhibit translation, 5'-tiRNAAla and 5'-tiRNACys are particularly potent translational repressors (Figure 1B). Northern blotting analysis confirmed that luciferase transcripts are not degraded under these conditions (Figure 1B, NB). A dose response analysis comparing 5'- and 3'-tiRNAAla reveals that 5'-tiRNAAla represses translation at low micromolar concentrations (Figure S1). Since the abundance of tiRNAs in angiogenin- or arsenite-treated cells is ~10 fold less than that of tRNA (intracellular tRNA concentration is estimated to be ~10-200 muM depending on cell type (Dr. Tao Pan, personal communication)), similar inhibitory concentrations of tiRNAs are likely to be found in stressed cells. Our calculations predict that the ratio of tiRNAs to mRNAs in stressed cells is ~8, consistent with their ability to repress translation in vivo (see legend to Figure S1). However, actual ratios of tiRNA, mRNA and translation initiation factors found in stressed cells is not known. 5'-tiRNAAla (but not 3'-tiRNAAla) also significantly inhibits the translation of capped luciferase transcripts (Figure 1C), and addition of cap analogue, which inhibits cap-dependent translation, significantly increases the relative translational repression. Northern blotting analysis confirmed that luciferase transcripts are not degraded under these conditions (Figure 1C, NB). Since translation of uncapped mRNAs, or capped mRNAs in the presence of cap analogue, depends on eIF4G binding to the 5' terminus of mRNA, these results suggest that 5'-tiRNAAla interferes with some functions of eIF4G (e.g., binding to mRNA or/and eIF4E).
