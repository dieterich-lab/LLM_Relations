G protein betagamma subunit-mediated activation of effectors has diverse roles in regulating of cell physiology. In excitable cells, Gbetagamma subunits released from Gi modulate membrane potential through activation of K+ channels and inhibition of voltage gated Ca2+ channels. In neurons this suppresses excitability and inhibits neurotransmitter release. In atrial myocytes vagal release of acetylcholine suppresses heart rate through Gbetagamma-dependent activation of K+ channels. In migrating immune cells, chemokine receptors, such as the IL-8 receptor or CXCR4, are coupled to the release of Gbetagamma subunits from Gi that is critical for mediating directional chemotaxis as well as release of superoxide and other inflammatory mediators. Several mouse knockout studies implicate Gbetagamma-regulated effectors in various physiological functions; For example, in mice lacking Gbetagamma-regulated PLCbeta3, morphine acting at Gi linked opioid receptors produced painkilling effects at much lower doses. Genetic deletion of Gbetagamma-regulated PI3Kg resulted in decreased neutrophil migration and a reduction in inflammation.
