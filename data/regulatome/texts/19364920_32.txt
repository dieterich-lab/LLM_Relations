Cby acts as an antagonist of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling in mammalian cultured cells and Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Thus, we evaluated the status of beta-catenin-dependent transcription in nasal epithelia from Cby-/- mice and age-matched controls using quantitative PCR for the direct beta-catenin targets Axin2 and CyclinD1. We observed a consistent increase in the expression of these genes in the Cby-/- tissue (Fig. 5 A). Similar results were obtained for primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMEFs) derived from Cby-/- and Cby+/+ embryos (Fig. 5 B). These data are consistent with Cby being a beta-catenin antagonist and raise the question of whether Cby-/- mice display changes in the localization of Wnt-beta-catenin pathway components such as adenomatosis polyposis coli, beta-catenin, and Dishevelled, which have been shown to localize to the ciliary base. Therefore, we analyzed the localization of beta-catenin and Dvl1 in nasal ciliated cells from Cby-/- mice and littermate controls. Lateral membranous beta-catenin and apical Dvl1 localization remained unchanged in the absence of Cby (Fig. S3, A-L). Based on these results, it is not clear whether the ciliary phenotypes of Cby-/- mice are related to the modest elevation of Wnt-beta-catenin target genes in these mice. These and other questions that seek to link the mechanisms of Wnt signaling to discrete subcellular compartments and structures await further research.
