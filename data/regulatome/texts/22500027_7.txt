We used multiple approaches to identify BBSome assembly intermediates including introducing point mutations found in BBS patients into individual BBS proteins, the utilization of knock-out mice, and the use of RNAi against BBS genes to disrupt BBSome formation. In addition, we overexpressed specific BBSome subunits that resulted in the assembly and accumulation of distinct BBSome intermediates. By characterizing these intermediates, we demonstrate that BBSome assembly is an ordered process involving the chaperonin-like BBS proteins (BBS6, BBS10, and BBS12) and intrinsic protein-protein interactions.
