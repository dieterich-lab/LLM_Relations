The murine Six3 gene is one of the earliest markers of the anterior forebrain and midline, structures known to be important in HPE pathogenesis. However, complete absence of the Six3 gene leads to anterior truncations of the forebrain, not classical HPE (see Fig. 1F to F'). In contrast, heterozygous mutations in human SIX3 are the third most commonly detected sequence variations among HPE patients. Genetic and biochemical studies of Six3 have demonstrated several essential roles at different times during development of the forebrain and eyes including anti-BMP and as a Groucho-dependent repressor of Wnt signals. The Six3 gene also encodes one of several transcription factors present in the eye field where it functions to inhibit caudalizing Wnt signals. An additional property of Six3 is its interaction with the cell cycle regulator, gemenin, where it can promote the continuing proliferation of retinal progenitors. Given these multiple roles, it was initially difficult to understand how Six3 fit into the HPE scheme.
