Previous studies have demonstrated that several transcription factors are responsible for the regulation of ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes. For example, liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), and GATA transcription factors have been shown to regulate these genes through the intergenic promoter regions. The LXRalpha, bound to the response elements identified in this study, is very likely to interact with other transcription factors which are bound to the intergenic promoter regions. To test this possibility, we have constructed reporter plasmids which contain the 144-bp intergenic promoter region and LXREs in the ECRs 10 and 20. Moderate synergistic transcriptional activation resulted when combinations of five transcription factors, LXRalpha, RXRalpha, GATA4, HNF4alpha, and LRH-1, were tested with pABCG8-LUC, which contains only the intergenic promoter (Fig. 3B). With pE19,20-6'-ABCG8-LUC, which contains the LXRE of ECR20 in addition to the intergenic promoter, strong synergistic transcriptional activation (up to 21 fold) resulted. On the other hand, with pE10,11-3-ABCG8-LUC, which contains the LXRE of ECR10, no striking synergy was observed. However, when both LXREs were inserted upstream from the intergenic promoter region (p(E19,20-6')-(E10,11-3)-ABCG8-LUC(up to 36 fold) resulted, suggesting that both LXREs may play significant roles in regulating ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes. To find out which transcription factors, in combination with LXR/RXR, play important roles in synergistic transcriptional activation, diverse combinations of transcriptional factors were tested with pE19,20-6'-ABCG8-LUC. All of the three transcription factors GATA4, HNF4alpha, and LRH-1 appear to play significant roles in synergistic transcriptional activation (Fig. 3C).
