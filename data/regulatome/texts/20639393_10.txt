To analyze cadherin-23/harmonin interactions, we produced the entire cytoplasmic regions of both cadherin-23 isoforms (CDH23 + exon68 and CDH23Deltaexon68) and the full-length harmonin-a isoform. We determined the harmonin-a concentration dependence of the steady-state binding signal to either CDH23 + exon68 or CDH23Deltaexon68 using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were very similar for both CDH23 isoforms (Table 1), which argues against exon 68 playing a significant role in harmonin binding. Surprisingly, these Kd values (97 +/- 14 and 79 +/- 11 nm) are much lower than those reported for the interaction of single PDZ domains with their binding partners. Because such a high-affinity cadherin-23/harmonin-a interaction could result from the involvement of several harmonin-a domains, we studied the interactions of truncated forms of harmonin-a with CDH23. No binding signal could be detected for either the Nter or the PDZ3 domains alone--proper folding of both truncated proteins was checked by circular dichroism experiments--at the highest concentration used (500 nm), which indicates that the corresponding Kd values are higher than 5 microm. This value is consistent with the previously reported Kd (25 microm) of the complex between Nter and a 20-residue CDH23 peptide. In contrast, the affinities of the Nter-PDZ1 fragment for the two CDH23 isoforms were similar to those of the full-length harmonin-a, while those of the Nter-PDZ1-PDZ2 fragment were only 1.5-1.9 times higher (Table 1). We deleted the C-terminal consensus PDZ-binding motif (ITEL) in both CDH23 isoforms and studied the binding of these DeltaITEL fragments to harmonin-a, Nter-PDZ1-PDZ2 and Nter-PDZ1. The Kd values for the DeltaITEL fragments were similar to those for the entire CDH23 isoforms, showing that the ITEL motif of CDH23 does not play an important role in the strengthening of the cadherin-23/harmonin-a complex (Table 1). This result, combined with the unusually low Kd values we measured, suggests that the binding mechanism between harmonin-a and cadherin-23 is non-canonical. Accordingly, the defective mechanoelectrical transduction resulting from the missense mutation that has been introduced in the PDZ2 domain of murine harmonin (harmonin-PDZ2AAA allele) and predicted to disrupt the binding to the ITEL motif of cadherin-23 is in fact more likely to be explained by the abnormal interaction between harmonin and other proteins containing a consensus PDZ-binding motif, which may include protocadherin-15.
