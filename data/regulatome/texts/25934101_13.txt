HEK cell transfection and immunoprecipitation to determine Nbea wild-type (WT) and E2218R binding with SAP102 and PFKM was performed as detailed previously. SAP102 and Nbea WT and KO neurons were allowed to grow till day in vitro (DIV) 14 before fixation. Nbea KO neurons transfected with NbeaDeltaPKA and E2218R Nbea at DIV 3 were fixed between DIVs 15 and 17. alpha-SAP102 (mouse monoclonal, NeuroMab clone N19/2, 1:100), alpha-Nbea (rabbit polyclonal, SySy, 1:1000), alpha-MAP2 (chicken polyclonal, Abcam ab5392, 1:10000) and alpha-Actin (mouse monoclonal, Chemicon, 1:200) were used for immunofluorescence staining. Detailed description of staining procedure and Nbea antibody description has been reported previously.
