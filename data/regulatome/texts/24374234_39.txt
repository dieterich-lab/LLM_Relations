In summary, our studies show for the first time that insulin stimulates colocalization of MyoIIA and F-actin at the site of GLUT4 vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane of adipocytes. We also demonstrate that impairing MyoIIA translocation to the plasma membrane by either blebbistatin treatment or reduced calcium levels prevents increases in F-actin at the plasma membrane. The requirement of MyoIIA to localize F-actin may facilitate the actin reorganization required for GLUT4 vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane. The requirement for MyoIIA suggests that it may assist with actin reorganization by both stabilizing F-actin and also to contracting F-actin to facilitate GLUT4 vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane. It is also possible that MyoIIA regulates F-actin turnover by acting as a depolymerization agent. Finally we demonstrated that calcium is necessary but not sufficient in the colocalization of MyoIIA and F-actin at the plasma membrane. Collectively, our results are the first to reveal that MyoIIA facilitates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-LI adipocytes by localizing F-actin to the site of GLUT4 vesicle fusion. Characterization of the role of MyoII in GLUT4 vesicle trafficking is critical to understanding the role of the cytoskeleton in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and will provide new targets for regulation.
