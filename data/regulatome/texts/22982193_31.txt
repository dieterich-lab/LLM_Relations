Histone modifications dependent on the Paf1C are well documented as being important for the repair of DNA damage in both yeast and human systems. For example, Dot1 participates in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and can promote recruitment of Rad9/52BP1, which is involved in DNA damage checkpoint signaling. Rad6 and Bre1 also are involved in recruitment of downstream effectors of DSB repair like Rad51 and Brca1. The repair of DNA damage by nucleotide excision repair (NER) occurs thorough two major pathways, global genome (GG-NER) repair and transcription coupled repair (TC-NER). Members of the Paf1C complex, histone modifiers and FACT have all been implicated to differing extents as participating in these NER pathways. Additional studies will be needed to elucidate the contribution of the Paf1C to DNA damage repair pathways and determine if all of its roles require its histone modifications functions.
