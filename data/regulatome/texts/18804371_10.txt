In this paper, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms controlling the asymmetric localization of the polarity proteins in pupal wing cells. We concentrate on the generation of molecular asymmetry, in which we consider how a protein complex forms with Fz:Dsh on one side of the cell-cell boundary and Stbm:Pk on the other, focusing particularly on the role of Fmi in this process. We find that Fmi binds preferentially to the Fz:Dsh complex and identify the C terminus of Fmi as important for promoting its association with Stbm:Pk. Moreover, we find that Fmi requires intercellular stabilization by proximal and distal-complex components at adherens junctions and that the stability of Fmi at junctions affects its rate of entry into endocytic trafficking pathways. Finally, our data suggest that trafficking of Fmi occurs via both Dsh-dependent and Dsh-independent mechanisms.
