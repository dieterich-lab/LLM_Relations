Using the BLAST server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), template structures homologous to OppA were sought, but no appreciable homology was found in the Brookhaven pdb database. Appropriate template structures were therefore chosen by comparing the results of fold prediction servers 3DPSSM (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~3dpssm/), GENTHREADER (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psiform.html), FFAS (http://www. bioinformatics.burnham-inst.org/FFAS/index.html), UCLA-DOE (http://fold.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/psiform/), BIOINBGU (http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~bioinbgu/), and FUGUE (http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~fugue/). The best template which came out from these analyses was OppA of Salmonella typhimurium complexed with the peptide KAK (pdb code 1JET). This was used as template to model the structure of OppA of M. tuberculosis (OppAMTB) using the software MODELER. The output was a 3D model for the target sequence containing all main chain and side chain non-hydrogen atoms. Amino acid residues I77 to R591 of OppAMTB were modeled. The N-terminal 76 residues could not be modeled due to lack of homology. A total of 20 models were generated and the final model was selected based on its stereochemical properties. This model was subjected to energy minimization using the Insight II Version 2000 (Accelrys Inc.) software package, using the steepest descent minimization algorithm in the discover module of Insight II. The overall stereochemical quality of the final models was assessed by the program PROCHECK. The resolution was set at 1.5 Aa. The final models were verified through the program VERIFY 3D (http://www.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/Services/Verify_3D/) and ERRAT (http://www.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/Services/Errat.html).
