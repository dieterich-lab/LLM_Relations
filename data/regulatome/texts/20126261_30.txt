Previous studies in Drosophila and mammalian cells indicate that PINK1 functions genetically upstream of Parkin, although the molecular mechanism of this genetic interaction remains unexplained. To test whether PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is upstream of Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria, we assessed the dependence of PINK1 accumulation on Parkin expression. Endogenous PINK1 accumulates similarly in HeLa cells, which display little or no endogenous Parkin expression, and HeLa cells stably expressing YFP-Parkin (Figure S2D). Consistent with these findings, we observed that exogenous PINK1-myc accumulates similarly in immortalized Parkin-/- and Parkin+/+ MEFs (Figure S2E). Together, these results show that PINK1 accumulation is upstream of Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria and independent of Parkin expression.
