Based on our previous data that loss of Eya phosphatase results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of H2AX, we predicted that depleting Eya in 293T cells would result in decreased binding of MDC1 to H2AX in response to DNA damage. We knocked down Eya3 using specific siRNA and subsequently tested for MDC1-H2AX interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. As predicted, loss of Eya3 resulted in complete loss of this interaction in comparison to untransfected cells treated with 10Gy IR (Supplementary Fig. 11).
