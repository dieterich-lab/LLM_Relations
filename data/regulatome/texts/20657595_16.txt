As previously described, the epidermis of newborn LEKTI-deficient mice mimicked Netherton syndrome epidermis by the extensive loss of the stratum corneum (compare Figure 5a and b). Compatible with a key role of matriptase in premature pro-kallikrein activation, the ablation of matriptase from LEKTI-deficient epidermis prevented spontaneous stratum corneum loss (compare Figure 5b and d), and LEKTI and matriptase double-deficient epidermis was outwardly indistinguishable from matriptase-deficient epidermis (compare Figure 5c and d). Stratum corneum loss in LEKTI-deficient skin was caused by separation of the epidermis at the granular-transitional cell layer boundary, and lead to the direct exposure of the living layers of the epidermis to the external environment (compare Figure 5e and f). However, epidermal separation at the granular-transitional cell layer boundary no longer was observed in LEKTI and matriptase double-deficient epidermis (compare Figure 5f and h), which was histologically indistinguishable from matriptase-deficient epidermis (compare Figure 5g and h). Elimination of matriptase from LEKTI-deficient epidermis also restored keratohyalin granules in the upper epidermis (compare Figure 5f and h) that contained profilaggrin, as determined by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Figure 4a-d). Furthermore, loss of matriptase prevented the accelerated processing of profilaggrin that is characteristic of LEKTI-deficient human and mouse epidermis, thus further supporting matriptase acting upstream of epidermal kallikreins (Supplementary Figure 4e and f). In addition to improving both the outward and histological appearance of the skin, the elimination of matriptase also led to a functional improvement of LEKTI-deficient epidermis in an established assay of inward-out epidermal barrier function (Figure 5i). Thus, although loss of matriptase by itself impairs epidermal barrier function by weakening epidermal tight junctions and by preventing calpain/caspase-14/bleomycin-mediated profilaggrin/filaggrin processing, the ablation of the serine protease markedly improved, rather than further deteriorated, the barrier function of LEKTI-deficient epidermis. Taken together, the data show that the expression of these key features of Netherton syndrome in the LEKTI-deficient mouse model is matriptase-dependent.
