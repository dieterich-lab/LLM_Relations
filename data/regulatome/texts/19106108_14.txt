Treatment of Cells with Inhibitors against Specific Kinases--To evaluate the effect of specific kinases on N phosphorylation, the cells transfected with N expression constructs or infected with coronaviruses were treated with inhibitors against specific kinases, including LiCl and kenpaullone for GSK-3, wortmannin for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; 5,6-Dichlorobenzimidazole riboside for casein kinase 2, olomoucine for cyclin-dependent kinase, H89 for protein kinase A (all from Sigma-Aldrich), and U0126 for MEK (Calbiochem). The inhibitors were added into the culture medium with proper/effective concentrations 1 h before transfection (or virus infection) until the cytopathic effect (CPE) was recorded or the supernatant or lysates were harvested for subsequent analysis.
