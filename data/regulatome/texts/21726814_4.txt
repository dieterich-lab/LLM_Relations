RNA interference (RNAi) and related pathways are conserved modes of post-transcriptional gene silencing in which single-stranded guide RNAs bind to cognate mRNAs and direct their endonucleolytic cleavage or translational repression by RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs). Silencing is initiated by long dsRNAs or hairpin pre-microRNAs, which are processed by the endonuclease Dicer to yield 21-23 nt short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs (miRNAs), respectively. These small dsRNAs are then loaded onto Argonaute2 (Ago2), the endonuclease component of RISC. In humans, this process of RISC-loading involves both Dicer and TRBP. Together these proteins, along with Ago2, comprise the core of a complex termed the RISC-Loading Complex (RLC). Another dsRBP called PACT also binds to Dicer, but its specific function is as yet poorly understood.
