The results raise the obvious question "why use more than one motor?" We hypothesize that heterotrimeric kinesin-2 and cytoplasmic dynein 1b are core IFT motors that assemble and maintain the cilium foundation, whereas the other ciliary kinesins (e.g., OSM-3) are accessory motors that confer cilia-specific functions. The accessory motors may function to modulate IFT itself, they may target specific proteins to cilia, or they may function as stable components of the cilium itself. For example, in wild-type C. elegans, sensory cilia are assembled by two members of the kinesin-2 family, the core motor kinesin-II and the accessory kinesin OSM-3 (Fig. 1 b), whereas osm-3 mutants resemble Chlamydomonas, Tetrahymena, Drosophila, sea urchin, and mouse, in which disrupting the function of heterotrimeric kinesin-2 alone leads to the loss of cilia. The peculiar feature of C. elegans is that in klp-11 and kap-1 single mutants lacking kinesin-II function, OSM-3 alone appears capable of building the full-length cilium. Thus, in wild types, both motors function redundantly to carry out the important task of building the cilium foundation, which can form after the loss of either kinesin-II or OSM-3. Subsequently, the accessory motor OSM-3 alone specifically extends the distal singlets to confer cilia-specific chemosensory functions (i.e., osmotic avoidance).
