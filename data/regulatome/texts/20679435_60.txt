Densitometry analysis was performed with ImageJ free image analysis software (National Institutes of Health), and relative RhoG or Rac1 activity was determined by the amount of GTP-bound RhoG or Rac1 bound to GST-ELMO or -CRIB normalized to the amount of total RhoG or Rac1 in cell lysates, respectively. Statistical significance was established by t test using SPSS software (version 16.0; SPSS, Inc.).
