Pex3p is directly imported into peroxisomes. (A) Subcellular fractionation of wild-type CHO-K1 cells and those stably expressing Pex16p-HA. Organelle fractions from respective PNS fractions were separated by OptiPrep density gradient ultracentrifugation as described in Materials and methods. Distribution of peroxisomes, mitochondria, and ER (smooth and rough microsomes) were verified by immunoblotting using antibodies against marker proteins: Pex14p, Tom20, P450 reductase, and Sec61pbeta, respectively. Arrowheads and bars indicate the peak fractions of peroxisomes (Ps; lane. 2, top), mitochondria (Mt; lane 6, top), smooth and rough microsomes (sMic and rMic; lanes 9 and 6-8, respectively, top), and peroxisomes harboring Pex16p-HA (Ps+16; lane 2, bottom) that were used for in vitro import assays in B. (B) Pex3p-Myc is directly translocated to peroxisomes in a Pex16p-dependent manner. (left) In vitro Pex3p-Myc import assays were performed using Pex3p-Myc synthesized together with Pex19p in a rabbit reticulocyte-lysate system. Pex3p-Myc was incubated at 26degreesC for 1 h with equal protein amounts of peroxisomes (lane 3), mitochondria plus rough microsomes (lane 4), smooth microsomes (lane 5), and peroxisomes harboring Pex16p-HA (lane 2), respectively, in SB. The same amount of peroxisome fraction was heat denatured and used as an import-negative control (lane 6). After the reaction, organelles were recovered by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Targeted Pex3p-Myc levels in each fraction were quantitated using ImageJ software and shown by taking 1 as the value in the peroxisome (lane 3) fraction (bottom). (right) Pex16p expression levels in wild-type and HA-Pex16p-expressing cells were assessed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Pex16p antibody of equal protein amounts of organelle fractions. Closed and open arrowheads indicate endogenous Pex16p and Pex16p-HA, respectively. Total Pex16p levels were quantitated as in the left panel and shown by taking 1 as the value in the wild-type cells, in which the values are means +/- SD of three experiments (bottom). Closed and open bars indicate the relative expression levels of endogenous Pex16p and Pex16p-HA, respectively. (C) Pex3p-Myc is targeted and integrated into peroxisomal membranes. After the in vitro import assays, peroxisome and peroxisomes harboring Pex16p-HA fractions (B, left) were treated with 0.1 M Na2CO3. Membrane (M) and soluble (S) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies to Myc, Pex14p, and a matrix enzyme, acyl-CoA oxidase (AOx). Only AOx-B chain was shown.
