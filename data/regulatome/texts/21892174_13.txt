A published study has identified IFI16 as a sensor of DNA in human monocytes through the use of a biotin-labeled vaccinia virus DNA-precipitation method. To determine whether the human DDX41 senses viral DNA in human monocytes, we treated THP-1 cells, a human monocyte cell line, with shRNA targeting DDX41, IFI16 or STING and confirmed that expression of the targeted protein was knocked down (Fig. 3a). After knockdown of DDX41, IFI16 or STING in THP-1 cells, we stimulated the cells with vaccinia virus DNA, HSV-1 DNA, poly(dG:dC) or HSV-1 and measured IFN-beta and IL-6 in the culture supernatants by ELISA. Knockdown of DDX41 or STING in THP-1 cells eliminated the ability to produce large amounts of IFN-beta and IL-6 in response to DNA or HSV-1 (Fig. 3b-e). However, knockdown of IFI16 in THP-1 cells led to slightly lower responses of IFN-beta and IL-6 to DNA or HSV-1, which confirmed the results of a published study showing that IFI16 has a moderate role in viral DNA sensing.
