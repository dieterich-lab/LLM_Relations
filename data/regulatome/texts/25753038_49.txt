The notion that GLA residues of OCN allow binding of this molecule to hydroxyapatite, the mineral component of bone ECM, has never been established in vivo. Here we show that mice lacking Ggcx or Vkorc1 in osteoblasts are characterized by a nearly complete absence of OCN in their bones. These results provide the first genetic in vivo evidence that gamma-carboxylation of OCN is absolutely necessary for its accumulation in the bone ECM. Surprisingly, however, despite an absence of OCN in bone, the total serum levels of OCN were not increased in Ggcxfl/fl;OC-Cre or in Vkorc1fl/fl;OC-Cre mice. One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy could be that GLU-OCN has a shorter half-life than GLA-OCN in the serum or that other compensatory mechanisms exist to reduce circulating levels of GLU-OCN.
