Targeting promoters with siRNAs have been shown to relative with the facultative heterochromatin marks H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 in human cells. To determine whether miR-10a could induce these repressive histone modifications, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to screen the hoxd4 promoter for H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 at regions overlapping the miR-10a target site (Chip Box1: -1081 ~ -972) and the bisulphite sequencing PCR (BSP) detection site (Chip Box2: -330 ~ -122). Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 in the promoter region of the hoxd4 gene (Fig. 4d). After transfection with miR-10a, an increase in H3K27me3 in the two analysed regions (Box1 and Box2) was observed in both MCF7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4e). We next analysed the DNA methylation status by performing bisulphite sequencing of the hoxd4 promoter. Aberrant methylation is often observed in cancer cells. CpG and CpNpG methylation are both strongly correlated with gene silencing in plants. CpNpG methylation is rare in the human genome, and no functional implications for gene silencing have ever been documented. Consistents with previous studies, we found no CpNpG methylation in the our bisulfite-sequenced region (BSP Sequencing Region: -330 ~ -122). Cultures treated with mock duplexes presented CpG methylation in this region, but consistent with the observation that the hoxd4 mRNA level is lower in MCF7 than in MDA-MB-231 cell lines, the hoxd4 promoter region was clearly more densely methylated in MCF7 cells than in MDA-MB-231 cells. When the cultures were transfected with miR-10a duplexes, the extent of methylation increased compared to cultures treated with control RNA duplexes. Contrarily, when cells were treated with 2'-O-methyl-miR-10a (anti-miR-10a), we found that the extent of methylation decreased and was accompanied by upregulation hoxd4 expression in both cells types (Fig. 4f). These results thus indicate that the miR-10a-induced inhibition of hoxd4 transcription is accompanied by de novo DNA methylation and H3K27me3 formation in the targeted promoter region.
