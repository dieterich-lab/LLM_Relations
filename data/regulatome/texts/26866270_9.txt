To better understand the regulation of MLKL, we sought to identify MLKL-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid screen. We screened a human bone marrow cDNA library with MLKL (1-178aa.) as bait. The screen identified a clone encoding Hsp90, as confirmed by sequencing, to be a novel MLKL-interacting protein (Figure 1a). To confirm the MLKL-Hsp90 interaction in mammalian cells, 293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged Hsp90alpha and Myc-tagged MLKL. Extracts from the transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-Myc antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-Flag antibody for the presence of Flag-Hsp90alpha. As shown in Figure 1b, Flag-Hsp90alpha was readily detected in the Myc-MLKL immunoprecipitates but not in the control immunoprecipitates. In a reciprocal coIP experiment, Myc-MLKL can be readily detected in the Flag-Hsp90alpha immunoprecipitates (Figure 1c). We also observed that endogenous Hsp90 associates with endogenous MLKL in Hela cells (Figure 1d). These results demonstrate that Hsp90 physically interacts with MLKL in cells.
