RA serves as a ligand for two families of nuclear receptors that bind DNA and directly regulate transcription: (1) the RA receptors (RARalpha, RARbeta, and RARgamma) which bind the abundant form of RA known as all-trans-RA, and (2) the retinoid X receptors (RXRalpha, RXRbeta, and RXRgamma) which bind an isomer known as 9-cis-RA. However, 9-cis-RA is normally undetectable except when vitamin A is present in excess. Hence, it may play a pharmacological but not a physiological role as an RXR ligand. As RXR forms heterodimers with RAR and several other nuclear receptors when bound to DNA, this suggests that RXR functions as a scaffold protein to facilitate DNA-binding for several different types of nuclear receptors. In vivo studies have demonstrated that ligand binding to just the RAR portion of RAR/RXR heterodimers is sufficient and necessary to rescue a lethal defect in RA synthesis, whereas ligand binding to RXR does not rescue the defect and is unnecessary. When RA binds to the RAR partner of RAR/RXR heterodimers bound to a regulatory DNA element, this stimulates a cascade of events resulting in recruitment of transcriptional coactivators and initiation of transcription.
