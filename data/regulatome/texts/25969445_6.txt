Another human homolog of yeast Rrp1p, RRP1B, is associated with pre-60S, is involved in recruitment of protein phosphatase 1 to pre-60S and is suggested to be the functional ortholog of yeast Rrp1p. Despite these reports, however, depletion of RRP1B induces only a small effect on pre-rRNA processing and no effect on pre-ribosomal particle assembly. In addition, there have been many other reports of the roles that RRP1B has in cellular functions other than ribosome biogenesis, including those in susceptibility for cancer progression and metastasis, in modulation of transcription and chromatin structure and in E2F-mediated apoptosis. Thus, involvement of RRP1B in human ribosome biogenesis is controversial. Our previous results suggest that RRP1, but not RRP1B, may be the functional ortholog of Rrp1p and may participate in human ribosome biogenesis.
