The second mutant with a strong dominant-negative phenotype on cell proliferation and rRNA processing was M5. Similar to M1, mutant M5 protein localized to the nucleolus and co-immunoprecipitated Bop1 and WDR12. However, we noticed a specific difference in the processing of the 5.8S rRNA for mutants M1 and M5. While the amount of 12S pre-rRNA was reduced for mutant M1, the levels of 12S pre-rRNA were unchanged for the mutant M5. This suggests an inhibition of 12S pre-rRNA processing by mutant M5 and an accumulation of this precursor, whereas 12S pre-rRNA processing proceeds in the presence of mutant M1. The data suggests that the PeBoW-complex is required for consecutive rRNA processing steps during maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit and that mutant M5 can block the processing of the 12S pre-rRNA in addition to the 32S pre-rRNA. Accordingly, the C-terminal domain of Pes1 is required for processing of the 32S and 12S pre-rRNA precursors, whereas the N-terminal domain appears to be dispensable for processing of the latter.
