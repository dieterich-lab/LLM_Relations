Small GTPases demonstrate a relatively weak intrinsic ability to hydrolyze GTP that can be significantly enhanced by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). There are many potential GAPs for each subfamily of the small GTPases but those acting on Rho family proteins are especially numerous. In addition to the conserved GAP catalytic domain, these proteins contain a variety of other domains that mediate additional protein interactions or confer additional levels of regulation upon individual GAPs.
