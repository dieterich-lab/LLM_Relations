Phosphorylation of hUPF1 induces formation of mRNA surveillance complexes containing hSMG-5 and hSMG-7.  Eukaryotic mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) are degraded by a process known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). NMD has been suggested to require the recognition of PTC by an mRNA surveillance complex containing UPF1/SMG-2. In multicellular organisms, UPF1/SMG-2 is a phosphoprotein, and its phosphorylation contributes to NMD. Here we show that phosphorylated hUPF1, the human ortholog of UPF1/SMG-2, forms a complex with human orthologs of the C. elegans NMD proteins SMG-5 and SMG-7. The complex also associates with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), resulting in dephosphorylation of hUPF1. Overexpression of hSMG-5 mutants that retain interaction with P-hUPF1 but which cannot induce its dephosphorylation impair NMD, suggesting that NMD requires P-hUPF1 dephosphorylation. We also show that P-hUPF1 forms distinct complexes containing different isoforms of hUPF3A. We propose that sequential phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of hUPF1 by hSMG-1 and PP2A, respectively, contribute to the remodeling of the mRNA surveillance complex.
