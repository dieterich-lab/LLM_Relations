Nonsense point mutations in CALM are responsible for hematopoietic and iron metabolism abnormalities, growth retardation, and shortened life span in fit1 mice, the strongest phenotypes resulting from premature translational termination in the CALMANTH domain. The CALM/PICALM gene has also been directly implicated in alterations in cognitive function with increasing age in risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and in modifying the toxicity of Abeta in a yeast, C. elegans and primary rat cortical neuron models. These pathophysiological effects could, until now, only be explained by the role of CALM in linking clathrin to the PtdIns4,5P2-containing membrane during endocytosis, a role replicated by all clathrin adaptors. The work presented here raises the possibility that such effects are related to CALM's ability to directly drive the endocytosis of the small R-SNAREs VAMP8, VAMP3, and VAMP2, since failure to correctly transport these small R-SNARE VAMPs to early endosomes as a result of a reduction in CALM levels would perturb subsequent trafficking of a wide variety of proteins through the endocytic pathway. In the case of Alzheimer's especially it appears that any alterations in vesicle trafficking give rise to increased levels of Abeta production, presumably by modifying the localization of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) or that of its processing proteases (alpha-, beta-, and gamma secretases). Further, it has been documented that a major pathway for clearance of Abeta from the brain parenchyma is endocytosis by various cell types including astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells. The latter may further mediate Abeta clearance from the brain through the blood-brain-barrier by transcytosis, and it is of note that these cells were shown to possess the highest levels of CALM expression in the brain. This provides another possible explanation for why CALM has been linked to risk of Alzheimer's disease since CALM should play a key role in this endocytic process by selecting the R-SNAREs needed both for endocytic vesicle/endosome fusion and for subsequent fusion events along the endocytic pathway.
