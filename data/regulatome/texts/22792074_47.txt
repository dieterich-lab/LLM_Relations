A stalled replication fork with exposed single stranded and double stranded regions could provide an ideal DNA substrate for FANCJ. Indeed, FANCJ requires several nucleotides for binding and metabolizing DNA. FANCJ function in replication fork processing could also be similar to other 5'-3' DNA helicase/translocases such as Ecoli RecD and yeast Rad3. Rad3 facilitates exonucleolytic degradation of DNA ends, which restricts recombination between short homologous sequences. Interestingly, RecD regulates resection and recombination by changes in helicase speed, which can also facilitate a polymerase swap, in which bypass polymerases diminish fork break down. Conceivably, enhanced FANCJ enzyme activity or altered substrate preference due to acetylation could generate more single-stranded DNA to elicit checkpoint responses such as RPA loading as proposed. Alternatively, checkpoint maintenance could require reduced FANCJ enzyme activity so that FANCJ does not displace proteins from lesions, such as RAD51 or interacting partners BRCA1, RPA and BLM helicase. In this context, it is worth noting that changes in motor speed have been associated with FANCJ clinical mutants. The breast cancer associated mutant, M299I is enzyme activating and both unwinds and translocates DNA more efficiently than FANCJWT, whereas the P47A mutant is enzyme inactivating. Whether changes in FANCJ function derive from acetylation and/or partners that bind via this modification remains to be determined. Furthermore, based on our current data, it is unclear if distinct DNA lesions selectively induce FANCJ acetylation.
