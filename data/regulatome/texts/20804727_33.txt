We have further characterized this interaction by comparing the relative binding efficiency of Tacc3 to Int3 with that of a known Notch ICD binding partner, Rbpj. The Tacc3 and Rbpj proteins are similar in size 637 and 500 amino acids, respectively. Protein extracts were prepared from COS-1 cells that were co-transfected transiently with fixed concentrations of the Int3 expression vector and with increasing levels of the Tacc3 expression vector. Densitometric analysis (Figure 3Ae) of western blots of the whole cell lysate confirmed the fixed levels of Int3 (Figure 3Aa) and the increasing levels of Tacc3 (Figure 3Ab). Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the Int3 polyclonal rabbit antibody and western blot analysis was performed on the immunoprecipitate using a polyclonal antibody against mouse Tacc3 (Figure 3Ac). As the concentration of Tacc3 vector was increased the level of Tacc3-Int3 binding increased (Figure 3A, compare panels b and c and their respective densitometric histograms). We analyzed under similar conditions, Rbpj binding to Int3 in COS-1 cells. As in the previous experiment COS-1 cells were co-transfected transiently with a fixed concentration of the Int3 expression vector (Figure 3B) and increasing levels of the Rbpj expression vector (Figure 3Bb). Western blot analysis of the anti-Int3 immunoprecipitate for Rbpj indicated that increasing levels of Rbpj expression vector are associated with increased levels of Rbpj binding to Int3 (Figure 3B, compare panel b and c and their respective densitometry histograms, Panel e). This suggests that the binding of Tacc3 and Rbpj to Int3 is stoichiometrically similar (compare Figure 3a and 3b panel c).
