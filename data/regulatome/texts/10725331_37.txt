A second peak containing SMN and Gemin2, but lacking Gemin3 and Gemin4, is observed at lower molecular mass fractions that correspond to ~100 kD. The SMN protein present in these fractions was not detectable with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the peptide sequence encoded by exon 7 of SMN (Liu et al. 1997; Fig. 4 B). Thus, this smaller SMN-Gemin2 complex contains the oligomerization-deficient form of SMN lacking amino acids encoded by exon 7, which is most likely produced by the SMN2 gene (see Discussion; Gennarelli et al. 1995; Lefebvre et al. 1995; Pellizzoni et al. 1999).
