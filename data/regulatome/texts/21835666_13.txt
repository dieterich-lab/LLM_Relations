As a starting point for this study, we asked if nucleotide is required during TA protein handoff from the TRC to Get3. For this purpose we utilized our previously established in vitro system that monitors this step in the GET pathway (Figure 1A). Briefly, we in vitro translate Sec22-encoding mRNA in the SGT2FLAG Deltaget3/5 extract and then immobilize the resulting Sgt2FLAG-Sec22 complexes on anti-FLAG resin. Addition of recombinant Get3 and Get4-Get5 (a complex formed by bacterial coexpression of Get4 and Get5) results in efficient Sec22 elution from the resin in the form Get3-Sec22 complexes that are insertion competent. Get4-Get5 doesn't promote Sec22 elution on its own; rather it enhances the formation of Get3-Sec22 complexes by tethering Get3 to Sgt2. Notably, these original experiments were carried out in the presence of an ATP regenerating system. When we used ATP instead, we observed similar results as before: Get3 alone resulted in some increase in Sec22 elution above background (Figure 1B; 2% vs. 9%) and elution was strongly stimulated upon further addition of Get4-Get5 (Figure 1B; 9% vs. 63%). On the other hand, when we excluded ATP from this assay and added Apyrase to hydrolyze any residual ATP/ADP to AMP, Sec22 elution by Get3 alone was not affected (Figure 1B: 9% with ATP vs. 10% without) but the stimulatory effect of Get4-Get5 became marginal (Figure 1B; 63% with ATP vs. 16% without). To confirm that nucleotide binding to Get3 is necessary for optimal Get3-TA protein complex formation, we used Get3 with a G30R mutation in the Walker A motif that abolishes nucleotide binding in many related ATPases. Indeed, Get3G30R (Figure S1A) eluted Sec22 poorly compared to wild-type Get3 when Get4-Get5 and ATP were present (Figure 1C).
