We have established that NOL11 is involved in ribosome biogenesis, but is it a t-UTP? Affinity purification and mass spectrometry of hUTP4/Cirhin-associated proteins place NOL11 in a complex that contains four out of the five known human t-UTPs, strongly suggesting that NOL11 is indeed a t-UTP. Additionally, after ActD treatment, NOL11 is sequestered with the Pol I transcription machinery in pseudo-NORs. Interestingly, NOL11 is not found in pseudo-NORs during active rDNA transcription, which suggests that in the absence of rDNA transcription NOL11 is in excess and therefore is able to interact with pseudo-NORs. It could also suggest that NOL11 is only involved in active transcription, since pseudo-NORs are transcriptionally silent, even in the absence of ActD. Not only does NOL11 associate with the Pol I transcription machinery and the other t-UTPs, but it co-immunoprecipitates fibrillarin, demonstrating that NOL11 is able to associate with the SSU processome. As in yeast, this association with the SSU processome only occurs in the presence of rDNA transcription. siRNA knockdown followed by Northern blot analysis confirms that NOL11 is required for SSU processome mediated cleavages of the pre-rRNA. siRNA knockdown of NOL11 also results in a 40-50% reduction in rDNA transcription, showing that NOL11 has dual roles in both optimal pre-rRNA processing and transcription, which is expected for a t-UTP.
