In marked contrast to ATRT1989A, neither ATRS428A nor ATRS435/436/437A failed to activate Chk1 (Figs. 2D and S2G), showing that among the phosphorylation sites of ATR that we identified, T1989 is the only one critical for ATR activation. Since ATR is critical for genomic stability in cycling cells, deletion of ATR from ATRflox/- cells resulted in loss of cell viability. Expression of ATRWT, but not ATRT1989A, suppressed the growth defects of Ad-Cre-infected ATRflox/- cells in both cell proliferation and colony formation assays (Figs. 2E and S2H). These results suggest that T1989 is not only critical for the activation of ATR by extrinsic DNA damage, but also for its essential function in cycling cells.
