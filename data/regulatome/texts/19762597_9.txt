To reveal the mechanism by which SCFFBXL5 targets IRP2 for degradation in both an iron- and oxygen-dependent manner, we conducted an immunoblot analysis, which revealed that both FBXL5-FLAG (Fig. 3A) and endogenous FBXL5 (Fig. 3C) protein levels were low when iron is limiting but increased by more than an order of magnitude under iron-replete conditions. This difference was attenuated by addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, FBXL5-FLAG protein levels were inversely regulated with respect to IRP2 (Fig. 3B). Because FBXL5 mRNA levels did not change significantly as a function of iron (Fig. 1D) and iron-dependent regulation of exogenous FBXL5-FLAG did not require elements from the FBXL5 promoter or UTRs, these data indicate that FBXL5 is posttranslationally targeted for pro-teasomal degradation in an iron-dependent manner. FBXL5-FLAG levels from iron-replete cells were also substantially lower when incubated under low-O2 conditions (Fig. 3D). Thus, both iron- and O2-dependent regulation of IRP2 may be mediated by reciprocal effects on FBXL5's stability.
