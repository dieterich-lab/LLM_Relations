FANCM was previously found to associate with MHF1-MHF2 through the region consisting of residues 661-800. We co-crystallized the FANCM fragment (FANCM661-800, designated FANCM-F) with MHF1-MHF2 and determined the structure of the complex (Table 1). The structure shows that one FANCM-F molecule binds to a (MHF1-MHF2)2 tetramer and that FANCM-F exhibits an extended conformation (Fig. 3a, b). The binding of FANCM-F to a pseudodyad-related (MHF1-MHF2)2 tetramer results in a pseudo-two-fold symmetric shape of FANCM-F, like two "V"s connected by a linker coil passing through the interspace formed by the two alpha3 helices of MHF2/MHF2'. Without association with MHF, FANCM-F appears to be disordered in solution, as the residues that do not participate in the interaction with MHF, including the N- and C-terminal FANCM-F and residues 730-750, either have no electron density or are highly flexible (Fig. 3c,d). The ordered portion of FANCM-F, folding into three alpha helices and irregular coil with elements of two small beta strands and two 310 helices, remains in almost continuous contact with (MHF1-MHF2)2 through wrapping around the MHF1 alpha1, alpha2 and MHF2 alpha2, alpha3 helices (Fig. 3a, b).
