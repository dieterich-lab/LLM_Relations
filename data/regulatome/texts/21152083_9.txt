Using in vivo confocal fluorescence microscopy, biochemical analyses and bioinformatic approaches, we characterized the deacylation kinetics of GAP-43 and identified the thioesterase involved in this process. It was found that GAP-43 is deacylated in vivo when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 and human HeLa cells through a mechanism mediated by APT-2, but not by APT-1. Inhibition of deacylation caused GAP-43 to accumulate in perinuclear structures while APT-2 overexpression increased the cytoplasmic pool of GAP-43. Additionally, it was also demonstrated that APT-2 overexpression affected the steady-state subcellular localization of acylated H-Ras. Thus, the results demonstrate that APT-2 is the protein thioesterase involved in the acylation/deacylation cycle operating in GAP-43 subcellular distribution.
