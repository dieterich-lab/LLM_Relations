Our demonstration that HIP functions to inhibit Ptc-1 upregulation in mouse testicular epithelial cells (TM3) exposed to Shh-containing conditioned media is the first direct evidence to date that Shh signaling is attenuated in cells that express full-length, membrane-bound HIP. The decrease in Ptc-1 induction caused by transfection with HIP is consistent with previous reports indicating that HIP can bind and reduce the availability of Shh and presumably prevent it from signaling through Ptc-1. In human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC), which express high levels of HIP, the addition of Shh-containing conditioned medium did not cause induction of Ptc-1, even though these cells express the receptor components Ptc-1 and Smo. In addition, others have shown that although Shh induces angiogenesis in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia, it has no effect on endothelial cell proliferation or migration in cell culture. Our finding that vascular EC express abundant amounts of HIP mRNA may explain the inability of these cells to respond to Shh. An analysis of various human cell lines and primary cells indicated that HIP is absent or expressed at low levels in other cell types, suggesting that in adults HIP is expressed primarily in EC. These results are supported by gene chip data analysis of more than 30 normal human tissues showing that HIP is most highly expressed in blood vessels or in vascular-rich tissues such as liver, lung, brain, and pancreas (data not shown). These results suggest a role for HIP in the normal function of blood vessels.
