Amino acid availability is a physiological regulator of the loading of RagA/B with GTP such that when amino acids are scarce, RagA/B loading with GTP is diminished. We next investigated the effect of cell starvation on the Rag-FLCN interaction and found that it was increased (Fig. 5 F). This starvation-induced stimulation of the FLCN-Rag interaction fits well with the preference of FLCN to bind RagA mutants that are defective in GTP binding (Fig. 5 C), as well as the selective enrichment of FLCN on lysosomes under such conditions (Fig. 4 C). However, the strong binding of FLCN to Rags in the absence of amino acids indicates that the simple binding of FLCN to Rags is not sufficient for their subsequent activation, and that an additional amino acid-dependent signal is required for this to occur.
