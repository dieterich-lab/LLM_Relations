In contrast with the findings with Orai1, STIM1(DeltaK), STIM1(DeltaS/P) and STIM1(DeltaS/PDeltaK) prevented activation of TRPC1 (Figs. 5e-g). Native STIM1 is sufficient for full activation of TRPC1, as evident from elimination of TRPC1 current by knockdown of STIM1 with siRNA (Fig. 3a) and by the dominant negative STIM1 mutants (Table1, Fig. 2). When expressed with TRPC1, STIM1(DeltaS/P), STIM1(DeltaK) and STIM1(DeltaS/PDeltaK) inhibit TRPC1 activity, most likely by scavenging the native STIM1 and preventing it from activating TRPC1. Finally, Fig. 5h shows that inhibition of TRPC1 activity by the STIM1 constructs is not due to reduced plasma membrane expression of TRPC1. The combined results in Figs. 5 indicate that STIM1 gates Orai1 and TRPC channels by different mechanisms.
