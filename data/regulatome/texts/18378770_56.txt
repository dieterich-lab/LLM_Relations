Bora is degraded after Plk1 activation in early mitosis but before metaphase, which is consistent with the fluctuation of the Bora levels in the cell cycle and with our proteasome inhibitor experiments (Figs. 1, 2, and 6). Thus, Bora joins a group of cell cycle regulators, such as Wee1, Emi1, and Claspin, whose degradation is mediated by SCF-beta-TrCP and controlled by Plk1. Plk1 interacts with a subset of its substrates through polo-box domain (PBD), which requires a prior priming phosphorylation. In the case of mitotic substrates, such as Wee1 and Emi1, the priming kinase usually is Cdk1. Other cell cycle-regulated kinases also function as priming kinases. For example, Claspin is phosphorylated by ATR upon DNA replication stress and prime phosphorylated Claspin is then phosphorylated and inactivated by Plk1, leading to the termination of the replication checkpoint signaling. We found that Plk1 directly phosphorylates the DSGxxT degron in Bora (Fig. 5). It is likely that the trigger for mitotic degradation of Bora is the activation of Plk1, although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that priming phosphorylation of Bora by another kinase enhances subsequent phosphorylation of its degron by Plk1.
