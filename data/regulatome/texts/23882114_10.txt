In this study, we set out to investigate Dicer localization in mammalian cells. We found that human Dicer dsRBD functions as a nonclassical nuclear localization signal (NLS) that can mediate the nuclear localization of a reporter construct. Mutational analysis identified a basic region on the surface of the dsRBD as essential for its nuclear accumulation. We further demonstrate that Dicer's dsRBD binds importins beta, 7, and 8. Unlike in S. pombe Dicer, the dsRBD-NLS of the human enzyme appears to be inhibited from driving nuclear localization of the full-length protein. However, upon deletion of the helicase domain, Dicer is able to accumulate in the nucleus after CRM1-dependent nuclear export is blocked with the drug leptomycin B (LMB). These observations, together with the results of heterokaryon assays, suggest that human Dicer is a shuttling protein whose steady state localization is cytoplasmic.
