Runx2 has two protein isoforms with the glutamine-arginine-rich domain (QA), DNA-binding runt homology domain, NLS, nuclear matrix targeting signal, and the transducin-like enhancer of split/groucho-interacting C-terminal pentapeptide VWRPY (for review see). To map the interaction domains between Runx2 and CHIP proteins, we expressed the human type I isoform of Runx2 and its deletion mutants in 293T cells. The GST pull-down experiment results show that among the different deletions of Runx2 (Fig. 1 D, top), the full-length (hRunx2 1-507) and the deletion mutant hRunx2(88-507) show strong interactions with GST-CHIP (Fig. 1 D, bottom; third and fourth lanes), whereas the deletion mutant hRunx2(1-340) has completely lost, and hRunx2(1-424) only has a weak interaction with GST-CHIP. These experiments suggest that the C-terminal end of Runx2, which is around the nuclear matrix-targeting signal motif, contributes to the interaction with CHIP. As CHIP contains a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain responsible for chaperone binding, a U-box domain important for E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and a central domain rich in charged residues, interaction with Runx2 was further mapped using a series of GST-CHIP deletion mutants (Fig. 1 E, top). The data show that both GST-TPR and GST-DeltaU-box fusion proteins interact with Myc-Runx2, but GST-U-box and GST-DeltaTPR do not (Fig. 1 E, bottom). This suggests that the TPR domain is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with Runx2.
