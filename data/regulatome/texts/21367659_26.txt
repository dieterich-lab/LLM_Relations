Among other isolated reports of FGFR4 mutation in cancer, likely gain of function can be logically predicted only for the Y367C mutant found in a breast cancer cell line. This residue is paralogous with other mutants found in the germline of patients with skeletal dysplasia or craniosynostosis syndromes and somatically in patients with diverse cancers, including FGFR2 Y375C and FGFR3 Y373C. Ectopic expression of the FGFR4 Y367C-encoding allele in HEK293 cells resulted in elevated levels of endogenous extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, but no transformed phenotypes were observed in NIH-3T3 cells expressing the Y367C mutant. Definitive characterization of the effects of this substitution on protein function requires further study.
