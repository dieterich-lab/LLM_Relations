To investigate the functional consequence of TAZ interaction with Amot and AmotL1, we have first examined the distribution of TAZ-S89A in response to co-expression of Amot as distribution of TAZ and YAP between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is a major regulatory event executed by the Hippo pathway to restrict the transcriptional co-activator activity. The distribution of TAZ and YAP regulated by the Hippo pathway is also evident in response to cell density. In sparse cells, TAZ and YAP are preferentially distributed in the nucleus, whereas in dense cell culture, when Hippo pathway is activated, TAZ and YAP are restricted more to the cytoplasm. FLAG-TAZ-S89A expressed in sparse cells was primarily detected in the nucleus. When expressed in transfected cells, Amot was predominantly in the cytoplasm with some dotty structures and essentially excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 2A). In cells without co-expression of HA-Amot, FLAG-TAZ-S89A was essentially in the nucleus (cell 1). When HA-Amot was expressed moderately, some FLAG-TAZ-S89A was seen to be shifted to the cytoplasm (cell 2). FLAG-TAZ was mostly shifted to the cytoplasm when HA-Amot was expressed at high levels (cells 3 and 4). Similar results were obtained when TAZ, YAP, and S127A were co-expressed with Amot or AmotL1 (data not shown). These results suggest that Amot is able to restrict TAZ and YAP as well as their Hippo refractory mutants by sequestering them in the cytoplasm in a manner that is independent of the Hippo pathway. To further validate this, we have examined the expression of TAZ target genes such as CTGF and Cyr61. CTGF is a well defined target gene of TAZ and YAP, and its expression is a functional outcome of interaction of TAZ-YAP with TEAD1-4 as the promoter region of CTGF gene contains several TEAD-binding elements. Cyr61 was shown to be up-regulated by TAZ and YAP in several microarray studies. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, MCF7 cells were transfected with vector control (columns 1-4) or construct to express S89A (columns 5-8) alone (columns 1 and 5) or together with Amot (columns 2 and 6), AmotL1 (columns 3 and 7), or both Amot and AmotL1 (columns 4 and 8). The expression of endogenous CTGF and Cyr61 genes was robustly increased by exogenous TAZ-S89A (column 5). When Amot and AmotL1 were co-expressed with S89A, enhanced expression of CTGF and Cyr61 was compromised (column 8), suggesting that Amot and AmotL1 can negatively regulate the functional outcome of TAZ-S89A. Amot or AmotL1 alone had noticeable inhibition of S89A-induced expression of CTGF (Fig. 2B, columns 6 and 7, respectively). However, Amot and AmotL1 alone had little impact on S89A-induced expression of Cyr61 (Fig. 2C, columns 6 and 7, respectively). These results suggest that in MCF7 cells, Amot and AmotL1 have additive and/or synergistic effect on inhibiting S89A-induced expression of endogenous CTGF and Cyr61 genes. The expression of the exogenous S89A, Amot, and/or AmotL1 in these cells was validated by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2D). We and others have shown that TAZ-S89A and YAP-S127A possess potent oncogenic property in NIH3T3 and MCF10A cells in conferring anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar. This oncogenic property of S89A and S127A in NIH3T3 cells was also suppressed when Amot was co-expressed (Fig. 2, E and F). These results, taken together, suggest that Amot and AmotL1 can negatively regulate the functional outcome of TAZ-S89A, most likely through Hippo pathway-independent sequestration in the cytoplasm.
