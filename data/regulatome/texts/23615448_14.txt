Next we biochemically analyzed the maturation efficiency of iron-dependent proteins upon loss of zfGrx3 function. We first measured the enzyme activity of the Fe/S protein aconitase in total cell extracts of zfGrx3-knockdown and wild-type embryos at 48 hpf. In zfGrx3-depleted extracts the total aconitase activity, that is, the sum of the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms, was reduced significantly to 79% compared with controls (Figure 3A). As a second iron-dependent protein, we analyzed the activity of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX), an enzyme relying on heme a/a3. Similar to aconitase activity, zfGrx3 morpholino-injected embryos contained only 82% COX activity relative to controls (Figure 3B). In contrast, the activity of malate dehydrogenase as an iron-independent enzyme did not change (Figure 3C). Given the amount of reduction in Grx3 in the pooled embryos to 40% (Figure 1B), the small but consistent drop of iron-dependent enzyme activities by 20% indicates that zfGrx3 is important for the maturation of these two iron-dependent enzymes. Together these results suggest a crucial role for zfGrx3 in iron metabolism in the erythropoietic cell lineage and likely also in other tissues.
