It was reported that a small proportion of the PRC2 complex is present in the cytoplasm of different cell types. In this work it was shown that cytosolic PRC2 regulates Actin polymerization through its ability to bind the guanine nucleotide exchange factor VAV1 and that this activity is linked to Ezh2 requirement for T-cell development in vivo . An additional possibility could be that PRC2 sumoylation may play a role in regulating non-chromatin associated PRC2 functions. The fact that we detect sumoylation of nuclear SUZ12 upon SUMO and UBC9 overexpression (data not shown) does not support this but further experiments in this direction will be required to validate such hypothesis.
