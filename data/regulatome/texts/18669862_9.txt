We thus report nine children with inherited MyD88 deficiency. The immunological pheno-type is similar to that of MyD88-deficient mice (tables S9 and S10), but the infectious phenotype is different. Like MyD88-deficient mice, the patients are vulnerable to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the nine MyD88-deficient patients were normally resistant to most common bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites (supplementary note 1 and tables S10 and S11). By contrast, MyD88-deficient mice are vulnerable to almost all pathogens tested (at least 35 microbes, tables S1 to S3). Because MyD88- and IRAK-4-deficient patients have indistinguishable cellular phenotypes, the clinical phenotype of the 32 known IRAK-4-deficient patients may be taken into account when comparing mice and humans. The broad vulnerability of MyD88-deficient mice to experimental infections suggested that TLRs were the principal pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors or the principal microbial sensors of innate immunity in vivo. The natural history of 41 patients with MyD88 or IRAK-4 deficiency suggests that the MyD88-and IRAK-4-dependent TLRs (and IL-1Rs) play a narrow, nonredundant role in protective immunity in natura. Although narrow, this role is vital early in life, because all affected children would probably have died before the advent of antibiotics. TIR signaling seems to be less important for survival later in life (supplementary note 1). This may be due to the compensatory effect of adaptive immunity and/or the maturation of TIR-independent innate immunity.
