As all of these proteins were expressed in and purified from human HEK-293T cells, it remained formally possible that an unidentified protein that co-purifies with Sestrin2 (and Sestrin1) is the actual receptor for leucine. To address this possibility, we prepared human Sestrin2 in bacteria, a heterologous system that does not encode a Sestrin homologue or even a TOR pathway. Consistent with the results obtained with Sestrin2 prepared in human cells, radiolabelled leucine bound to bacterially-produced Sestrin2, but not the RagA-RagC heterodimer, which was used as a control (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, in a thermal shift assay, leucine, but not arginine, shifted the melting temperature by up to 8.5degreesC of bacterially-produced Sestrin2, but not of two control proteins (Fig. 2D and S2E-F). Collectively, these data strongly argue that leucine binds directly to Sestrin2.
