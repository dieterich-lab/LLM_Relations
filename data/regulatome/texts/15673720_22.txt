GST-hMYH fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-sepharose 4B (Amersham Parmacia) and incubated with purified hMSH2/hMSH6 (hMutSalpha) heterodimers as described previously. GST-hMYH-hMutSalpha complexes were pelleted and detected by SDS-PAGE and western blotting with antibodies against hMSH6 (BD Biosciences). Concentrations of mutant and wild-type proteins bound to beads were estimated from Coomassie-stained gels, and similar levels of all GST-hMYH proteins in the assay were confirmed by western blotting with antibodies against hMYH.
