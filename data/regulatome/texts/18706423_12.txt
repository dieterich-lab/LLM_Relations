Overall, Tim8-Tim13 and Tim9-Tim10 complexes are structurally similar. The Tim fold consists of a pair of antiparallel helices joined by two disulfide bonds and a connecting loop. The four types of Tim molecules (Tim8, 9, 10, and 13) are structurally superimposable over 42-58 alphaC pairs, with no pairwise RMSD greater than 1.5 Aa (Table 2) despite sharing less than 25% sequence identity in any pairwise comparison (Fig. 1). Three Tim 8 molecules and three Tim13 molecules nestle alternately around a heterohexameric barrel, giving the barrel three-fold rotational symmetry (pseudo six-fold rotational symmetry) (Fig. 1). The N-terminal helices line the inside of the barrel, and the C-terminal helices line the outside of the barrel. The geometry is analogous to the Tim9-Tim10 complex. In fact, the two heterohexameric complexes can be superimposed with an RMSD of only 1.9 Aa over 314 alphaC pairs. Distinctively, the N and C-terminal helices project from one end of this barrel core, like the tentacles from a jellyfish (Fig. 1b). This architecture grossly resembles that of prefoldin and Skp chaperones, in which amphiphilic helical tentacles emanate from an umbrella-like beta-sheet domain. These tentacle regions are implicated in sequestering substrate from aggregation. The disorder observed at the tips of these tentacles (extreme N- and C-termini) in the Tim8-Tim13 and Tim9-Tim10 complexes could be the result of the lack of substrate molecule to lend an interaction surface.
