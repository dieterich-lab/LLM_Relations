PIASy mediates NEMO sumoylation and NF-kappaB activation in response to genotoxic stress.  Protein modification by SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) is an important regulatory mechanism for multiple cellular processes. SUMO-1 modification of NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator), the IkappaB kinase (IKK) regulatory subunit, is critical for activation of NF-kappaB by genotoxic agents. However, the SUMO ligase, and the mechanisms involved in NEMO sumoylation, remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that although small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against PIASy (protein inhibitor of activated STATy) inhibit NEMO sumoylation and NF-kappaB activation in response to genotoxic agents, overexpression of PIASy enhances these events. PIASy preferentially stimulates site-selective modification of NEMO by SUMO-1, but not SUMO-2 and SUMO-3, in vitro. PIASy-NEMO interaction is increased by genotoxic stress and occurs in the nucleus in a manner mutually exclusive with IKK interaction. In addition, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) also increases PIASy-NEMO interaction and NEMO sumoylation, whereas antioxidants prevent these events induced by DNA-damaging agents. Our findings demonstrate that PIASy is the first SUMO ligase for NEMO whose substrate specificity seems to be controlled by IKK interaction, subcellular targeting and oxidative stress conditions.
