Mass spectrometric proteomic analysis of the purified lamb brain KR showed that the enzyme is an orthologue of a protein annotated in human and other mammalian genome databanks as mu-crystallin (CRYM). This finding suggested that human CRYM has a previously unsuspected biological role as a KR. Direct confirmation that human CRYM is indeed a KR was obtained by showing that highly purified recombinantly expressed human CRYM possesses substantial KR activity. As noted for KRs purified from rat liver, porcine kidney and bovine brain, the lamb brain KR exhibits a pH optimum of ~5 with P2C as substrate.
