SHOC2-MRAS-PP1 complex positively regulates RAF activity and contributes to Noonan syndrome pathogenesis.  Dephosphorylation of the inhibitory "S259" site on RAF kinases (S259 on CRAF, S365 on BRAF) plays a key role in RAF activation. The MRAS GTPase, a close relative of RAS oncoproteins, interacts with SHOC2 and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to form a heterotrimeric holoenzyme that dephosphorylates this S259 RAF site. MRAS and SHOC2 function as PP1 regulatory subunits providing the complex with striking specificity against RAF. MRAS also functions as a targeting subunit as membrane localization is required for efficient RAF dephosphorylation and ERK pathway regulation in cells. SHOC2's predicted structure shows remarkable similarities to the A subunit of PP2A, suggesting a case of convergent structural evolution with the PP2A heterotrimer. We have identified multiple regions in SHOC2 involved in complex formation as well as residues in MRAS switch I and the interswitch region that help account for MRAS's unique effector specificity for SHOC2-PP1. MRAS, SHOC2, and PPP1CB are mutated in Noonan syndrome, and we show that syndromic mutations invariably promote complex formation with each other, but not necessarily with other interactors. Thus, Noonan syndrome in individuals with SHOC2, MRAS, or PPPC1B mutations is likely driven at the biochemical level by enhanced ternary complex formation and highlights the crucial role of this phosphatase holoenzyme in RAF S259 dephosphorylation, ERK pathway dynamics, and normal human development.
