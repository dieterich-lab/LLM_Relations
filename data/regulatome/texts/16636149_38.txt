It is noteworthy that by blocking E2-induced SphK1 activation without alterations in the baseline SphK activity, SphK1G82D attenuated the E2-stimulated EGFR transactivation. Moreover, although both SphK1- and SphK2-siRNA caused a decrease in the basal SphK activity, only SphK1-siRNA that inhibited E2-induced SphK1 activity was able to block the EGFR transactivation. In contrast, SphK2-siRNA had no effect on E2-induced SphK1 activity or EGFR transactivation. These results not only suggest a specific role for the SphK1 isoenzyme but also strongly indicate that the activation of SphK1, rather than its baseline activity, is critical for the E2-induced EGFR transactivation. In fact, the enzymatic function of SphK1 has been suggested to act at two levels: (a) the constitutive basal activity is involved in the catabolism of cellular sphingolipids and, therefore, may play a housekeeping role; and (b) the agonist-induced elevated activity is fundamental for its signaling role in the regulation of many biological functions, including cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenesis.
