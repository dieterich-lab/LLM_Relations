Growth factor treatment inhibits ankyrin B binding to L1CAM. 293 cells transfected with a cDNA encoding full-length rat L1CAM in the absence (A, C, and E) or presence (B, D, and F) of EGF. Ankyrin (A and B) and L1CAM (C and D) were detected by indirect immunofluorescence in double-labeled confocal sections through cell aggregates to permit the visualization of L1CAM and ankyrin B at the cell membrane. (E) Combined micrographs indicating ankyrin staining (red) and L1CAM staining (green) reveal clear codistribution of signal in the absence of EGF. In contrast, in the presence of EGF (F), L1CAM staining remains at the membrane, but ankyrin B staining is largely absent, appearing in a more uniform distribution throughout the cytosol. (G) Direct quantification shows a significant reduction of ankyrin B colocalization with L1CAM at the membrane in the presence of EGF (mean +/- SD; P < 0.01). (H) The method for quantifying ankyrin B localization to the membrane uses densitometry of a line scan (red) across a cell-cell junction where L1CAM is expressed (ankyrin B staining is shown here). The resulting intensity profile is used to determine a minimum signal for comparison to the value of the ankyrin B signal at the point where the maximum signal in the L1CAM channel occurs. These values are combined to give an index value using the equation index = (max-min)/min. Index values were averaged and normalized with respect to the control values. Error bars +/- SD. Bar, 10 mum.
