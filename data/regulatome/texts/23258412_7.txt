To test if DNA could stimulate the generation of the heat-resistant STING activator in vitro, we incubated HT DNA with L929-shSTING cytoplasmic extracts (S100) in the presence of ATP (fig. S1E). The reaction mixture was heated at 95degreesC to denature proteins. Remarkably, incubation of the supernatant with permeabilized Raw264.7 cells led to IRF3 dimerization (Fig. 1D, lane 2). This activity depended on the addition of DNA to the cytoplasmic extracts. Other DNA, including poly[dA:dT], poly[dG:dC] and ISD, also stimulated the generation of the STING activator in L929-shSTING cytoplasmic extracts, whereas poly[I:C] and single-stranded RNA had no activity (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained with permeabilized THP1 cells (fig. S1F). Knockdown of STING in the permeabilized THP1 cells abolished IRF3 activation by the heat-resistant factor generated by DNA transfected into L929 cells or DNA added to L929 cytosolic extracts (Fig. 1E). Control experiments showed that the knockdown of STING inhibited the activation of IRF3 and induction of IFNbeta and TNFalpha in THP1 cells by HT-DNA transfection (fig. S1G and S1H), but IRF3 activation by poly[I:C] transfection or Sendai virus infection, which is known to activate the RIG-I pathway, was unaffected by the STING knockdown (Fig. 1F). We also tested cytoplasmic extracts from several cell lines for their ability to produce the heat-resistant STING activator (Fig. 1G). Incubation of HT-DNA with extracts from primary MEF cells, mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) and L929 cells led to generation of the heat-resistant factor that activated IRF3. Human cell extracts from THP1, but not HEK293T, were also able to produce this STING activator. These results are in agreement with our previous finding that primary MEF, BMDM, L929 and THP1 cells, but not HEK293T cells, possessed the STING-dependent, RNA polymerase III -independent, pathway to induce type-I interferons. We next purified the heat-resistant STING activator from L929 cell extracts using several chromatographic steps including a STING-Flag affinity purification step (fig. S2, A and B). Previous research has shown that the bacterial molecules cyclic-di-AMP and cyclic-di-GMP bind to STING and induce type-I interferons. However, using nano liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS), we did not detect MS or MS/MS spectra consistent with those expected of c-di-GMP ([M+H]+=691) or c-di-AMP ([M+H]+=659). Interestingly, in-depth examination of the MS spectra revealed two ions with mass to charge ratios (m/z) of 675.1 (z=1+) and 338.1 (z=2+), which were present in the active fractions but absent in the background spectra (Fig. 2A). These m/z values, despite the low mass accuracy of the mass spectrometer (LTQ), were equivalent to the average calculated m/z values of c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP (675=[691 + 659]/2). This observation suggested that the detected ion was a hybrid of c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP, i.e., cyclic-GMP-AMP (m/z = 675.107, z=1+; m/z = 338.057, z=2+). Collision induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation of this ion (m/z = 338.1, z=2+) revealed several prominent ions with m/z values expected of the product ions of c-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) (Fig. 2B). Importantly, quantitative mass spectrometry using selective reaction monitoring (SRM) showed that the abundance of the ions representing cGAMP in the fractions from a C18 column correlated very well with their IRF3-stimulatory activities (Fig. 2C; fig. S2C). cGAMP has recently been identified in the bacterium Vibro cholera and shown to play a role in bacterial chemotaxis and colonization. However, cGAMP has not been reported to exist or function in eukaryotic cells.
