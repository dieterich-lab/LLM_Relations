B. AML-193 cells were serum starved for 15 hours, treated (+) or not (-) with AG490 (15 muM), and then stimulated (+) or not (-) with G-CSF (50 ng/ml) for 5 minutes. Anti-Gab2 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine to detect phospho-Gab2 (p-Gab2). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-Gab2 to identify total Gab2 (Gab2). Samples of total lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies to phospho-Jak2 (pJak2) and total Jak2 (Jak2), confirming Jak2 inhibition by AG490. The results indicate that the Jak kinase inhibitor AG490 inhibits G-CSF-stimulated Gab2 phosphorylation.
