We hypothesized that each motif in the GW182-ABD could bind a single Ago-miRNA complex concurrently. We therefore calculated the predicted molecular weight of the different complexes, examined these using SEC, and plotted the partition coefficient (Kav) obtained from the experiment as a function of the predicted MW of the complex (Figure 7A). As shown in the plot, the different hGW182-ABD truncations were clustered according to the number of available Ago-binding motifs. While the intact ABD correlated with binding of three hAgo2-guide RNA complexes, deletion of a single motif correlated with binding of two hAgo2-RNA complexes and the double motif truncations correlated with binding of a single hAgo2-RNA complex per hGW182 fragment (Figure 7A).
