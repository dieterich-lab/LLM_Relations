We have shown that let-7 family regulated self-renewal and inhibited Sox2, Nanog, Oct4 and Lin28B expression in PC3 PDGF-D cells with EMT phenotype. In order to assess the mechanistic link of these molecules (Sox2, Nanog, Oct4 and Lin28B) with the self-renewal capacity of PC3 PDGF-D cells, we knocked down the expression of Sox2, Nanog, Oct4 and Lin28B by siRNA transfection using Sox2, Nanog, Oct4 and Lin28B specific siRNA. We found that knock-down of Sox2, Nanog, Oct4 and Lin28B significantly repressed prostasphere-forming ability (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, PC3 PDGF-D cells transfected with Sox2, Nanog, Oct4 and Lin28B siRNA showed significantly increased numbers of prostaspheres in smaller size (30-50 microm) compared to that transfected with control siRNA concomitant with decreased numbers of prostaspheres with >50 microm in diameter (Fig. 7B). These results were consistent with protein expression results as shown in Fig. 7C, suggesting that Sox2, Nanog, Oct4 and Lin28B are required for self-renewal of PC3 PDGF-D cells.
