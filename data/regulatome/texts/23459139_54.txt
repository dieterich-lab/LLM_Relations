An in vitro study showed that there are no differences in the enzymatic activity of processed and unprocessed forms of human AGPS. Since peroxisomes lack DNA and protein synthesis capabilities, all peroxisomal proteins are synthesized in the cytosolic compartment and post-translationally sorted to the peroxisome. Insufficient cleavage of substrates interfered with their peroxisomal localization as observed in primary hepatocytes of Tysnd1-/- mice (Figure 6A-6C; Figure S6A-S6C, Figure S7E). Reduced peroxisomal targeting neither occurred in wild-type hepatocytes (Figure 6A-6F; Figure S7B-S7D) nor when peroxisomal protein Acox1 was co-expressed (Figure S7E) or overexpressed (data not shown), indicating that the peroxisomal import of PTS2-containing proteins was to some extent impaired in Tysnd1-/- hepatocytes while accumulating in the cells. The overall accumulation of peroxisomal proteins may lead to the saturation of the Pex5- and Pex7-mediated peroxisomal protein transport capacity. RNAi knockdown of Tysnd1 in Hela cells reportedly (data not shown) resulted in normal peroxisomal localization of Agps without apparent effect on the import system of peroxisomal proteins. We interpret the discrepancy between earlier reported results and ours, obtained from primary hepatocytes of Tysnd1-/- mice, as an effect of residual Tysnd1 protein expression after insufficient knock-down of Tysnd1 by RNAi.
