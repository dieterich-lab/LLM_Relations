To determine whether downregulation of RUNX1 or RUNX2 could inhibit LGALS3 expression in pituitary tumor, siRNA of RUNX1 and RUNX2 were transfected into HP75 cells, and the expression of RUNX1, RUNX2, and Gal-3 mRNAs were tested by RT-PCR. Validated siRNA (on-Target plus) duplex oligoribonucleotide against RUNX1, RUNX2, negative control (Non-targeting), and positive control (GAPDH) were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, Colo). The sequences are as follows: (i) RUNX1 (Genbank NM_001754.3) sense 5'-UGACAACCCUCUCU GCAGAUU-3', antisense 5'-UCUGCAGAGAGGGUUGU CAUU-3'; (ii) RUNX2 (Genbank NM_001015051) sense 5'-CAAGGACAGAGUCAGAUUAUU-3', antisense 5'-U AAUCUGACUCUGUCCUUGUU-3'; (iii) GAPDH (NM-002046) 5'-GUCAACGGAUUUGGUCGUA-3'. The duplex oligoribonucleotide were re-suspended in siRNA buffer provided by Dharmacon to make a 20 muM solution and stored at -20degreesC till further use. siRNAs were used at a final concentration of 100 nM. HP 75 cells were transfected in a 12-well plate at approximately 50% confluent using the DharmaFECT1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfections were carried out for 48 h in serum and antibiotic-free media. Knock-down of RUNX1, RUNX2, and Gal-3 mRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR. All experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated 3 times.
