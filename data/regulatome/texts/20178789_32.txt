Clustering of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in a membrane domain in which BKCa channels are co-localized could provide a mechanism for focal increases in Ca2+, conceivably of significant magnitude to stimulate BKCa opening. Consistent with this possibility Ca2+ sparklets (resulting from Ca2+ entry through clustered VGCCs) have been identified in arterial smooth muscle cells, while other studies have suggested a functional co-localization of BKCa and VGCC in caveolae. Data are not currently available, however, linking these events to pressure-induced activation of BKCa in intact arterioles.
