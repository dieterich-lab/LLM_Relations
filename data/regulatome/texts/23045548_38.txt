On the other hand, DDB2-dependent PARylation events also stimulate the preincision step of NER. We show that DDB2-dependent PARylation through PARP1 at UV-induced DNA lesions targets chromatin remodeler ALC1 to these sites. ALC1 belongs to the Swi2/Snf2 ATPase superfamily and through its macrodomain interacts transiently with chromatin that is modified by PARP1. We propose that these protein modifications serve to locally modulate chromatin structure through PARP1-stimulated nucleosome sliding to promote NER. Consistent with this scenario, we show that loss of ALC1 or chemical inhibition of PARP1 resulted in defects in the repair of CPDs concomitantly with increased sensitivity to UV exposure, underscoring the importance of the DDB2-PARP1-ALC1 pathway in promoting NER. We noted that the defects in CPD repair caused by loss of ALC1 or PARP1 activity are less pronounced than repair defects caused by loss of DDB2, suggesting that the essential role of DDB2 in CPD repair is not solely caused by its recruitment of PARP1-mediated activities, but also involves other functions of DDB2 such as its ubiquitin ligase activity. Interestingly, XPC contains a putative PAR-binding sequence, suggesting that UV-DDB-dependent PARylation may promote the accessibility of UV lesions through remodeling of the chromatin structure as well as providing an enhancer signal for the recruitment of preincision NER proteins.
