Recently, an essential IM protein, Tim22p, homologous to both Tim23p and Tim17p, has been identified. Tim22p is not required for the import of matrix-localized proteins, but Tim22p appears to be essential for the correct insertion of two membrane proteins, Aac1p, the ATP/ADP carrier, and PiC, the phosphate carrier, into the IM. Whether Tim22p is required for the import of other membrane proteins besides carrier proteins is not known. Tim22p is proposed to be in a separate complex from Tim23p and Tim17p in the IM, but other members of this new complex have not been identified. We have identified a new protein, Tim54p, which is essential for the IM insertion of the Aac1 carrier and Tim23 import proteins. Tim54p is not required for the translocation of precursors across the IM into the matrix. We find that Tim54p physically interacts with Tim22p, and forms an import complex in the IM separate from the Tim23p-Tim17p import machinery. Our results indicate that there are two import pathways in the IM. One pathway uses Tim23p and Tim17p in the translocation of precursors across the IM, and the other requires Tim54p and Tim22p for the insertion of proteins into the IM. Because Tim54p and Tim22p are both essential for yeast cell viability, we suggest that the Tim54p-Tim22p complex plays a key role in the insertion of many, if not all, proteins into the IM.
