Although earlier studies had shown that diazepam and other benzodiazepines could modulate circulating steroid levels, the identification of a natural polypeptide des-(Gly-Ile)-endozepine, also known as Diazepam Binding Inhibitor (DBI), that was able to stimulate cholesterol transport into isolated mitochondria, brought together the fields of steroidogenesis and benzodiazepines. DBI was originally characterized by Costa and Guidotti for its ability to displace diazepam from the benzodiazepine recognition site located on the type A receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) and later shown to physiologically modulate GABAA receptor function. The findings that TSPO was abundant in the OMM of adrenal mitochondria, and that DBI acts on the OMM to induce mitochondrial steroid formation, led to studies of the effects of well-characterized TSPO-binding families of compounds on corticosteroid and androgen formation by adrenal cortical and testicular Leydig cells, respectively. Exposure of structurally diverse TSPO ligands, including benzodiazepines, isoquinoline carboxamides and indole acetamides, to steroidogenic cell lines, primary steroidogenic cells and tissues, as well as isolated steroidogenic mitochondria, at concentrations close to their binding affinity consistently stimulates steroid synthesis 1.5-3.0-fold within minutes. Moreover, various TSPO ligands, namely flunitrazepam and 5-androsten-3beta,17,19-triol, at nanomolar and low micromolar concentrations, respectively, were able to block hormone-induced steroid formation in both cell lines and primary cells. Moreover, though not definitive proof of TSPO's involvement in steroidogenesis, DBI was shown to increase steroid formation when applied to isolated mitochondria, while its oligodeoxynucleotide-based knockdown blocked steroidogenesis in Leydig cell lines. Interestingly, DBI levels in the Leydig cells were reduced in hypophysectomized animals, suggesting a role in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal endocrine signaling axis. Two knockout DBI (ACBD1/ACBP) mouse models have been generated, resulting in either an embryonic lethality or metabolic defects, suggesting a complex and as yet unclear phenotype.
