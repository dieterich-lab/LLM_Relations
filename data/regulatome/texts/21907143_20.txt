The primary amino acid sequence of the CDP138 C2 domain is similar to the C2A and C2B domains from synaptotagamin-1, with 5 conserved aspartate residues in loop 1 and loop 3 regions (Figure 4A) that may interact with Ca2+. To test this possibility, we performed biophysical and functional analyses on the isolated C2 domain fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP). MBP, MBP-C2-WT and MBP-C2-5DA, a mutant lacking five aspartate residues (Figure 4B), have been analyzed for their Ca2+ and lipid membrane binding properties. The mutant C2-5DA domain fusion protein migrates faster in SDS-PAGE than the wild-type fusion protein, because the substitution of 5 aspartate residues with alanine changes the molecular weight and charge of the protein.
