Given the encouraging results achieved with targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in patients with lung tumors harboring EGFR mutations and ALK translocations, recent PDGFRalpha research has focused on identifying those lung cancers with aberrant tumor cell PDGFRalpha activity as potential candidates for PDGFRalpha-directed therapy. For instance, in a recent screen of NSCLC cell lines, 1 of 103 cell lines responded in vitro to the PDGFR inhibitor sunitinib. The sensitive cell line, H1703, was noted to have high-level PDGFRA amplification. Among the larger set of 637 human tumor-derived cell lines evaluated in the study, only one other, the PDGFRalpha-positive A-204 rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, responded to sunitinib, suggesting that only rare solid tumor patients might benefit from PDGFRalpha inhibition. However, such an approach does not account for the potential therapeutic effects of stromal PDGFRalpha inhibition. In tumor stroma, the PDGF-PDGFRalpha axis functions in fibroblast activation, aberrant epithelial-stromal interactions, modulation of tumor interstitial pressure, and production and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In studies with VEGF-null tumorigenic cells, PDGF-AA was identified as the major stromal fibroblast chemotactic factor produced by the tumor cells that lead to recruitment of VEGF-producing stromal fibroblasts for tumor angiogenesis and growth.
