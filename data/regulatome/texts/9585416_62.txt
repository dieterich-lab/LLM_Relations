The above explanations presume that LC8 is a subunit of four different axonemal structures, and is necessary for all four structures to assemble or bind to the doublet microtubules. An alternative explanation for the loss of inner arms, radial spokes, and beak-like projections in fla14 mutants is that the absence of LC8 affects transport of these structures in the flagellum. Both the radial spokes and the inner arms must be transported to the tip of the flagellum before binding to their normal sites on the doublet microtubules. In dikaryon rescue experiments, the beak-like projections are restored to fully formed flagella of mutants specifically lacking the projections, raising the possibility that these structures also are transported to the tip of the flagellum and then move back down the lumen of the B tubule to their binding sites. At least for the inner arms, movement to the tip of the flagellum is dependent upon FLA10, one of the subunits of the anterograde IFT motor. If defects in the fla14 flagellum prevented this transport, deficiencies in assembly of inner arms, radial spokes, and perhaps the beak-like projections would result. Although anterograde movement of rafts appears to proceed unimpaired in fla14 flagella, the movement of other components may be impeded.
