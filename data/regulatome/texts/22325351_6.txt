Core binding transcription factors are heterodimeric complexes composed of a common CBFbeta subunit bound to one of three tissue-specific DNA-binding CBFalpha subunits (now called Runx1,-2,-3). Like PRCs, core binding transcription factors play roles in stem cell self-renewal, tissue differentiation, and cancer (for review, see). Runx1 is the predominant hematopoietic expressed CBFalpha family member, whereas Runx2 and Runx3 play roles in bone and neural development. Targeted disruption of Runx1 in mice leads to complete failure of definitive hematopoiesis during embryogenesis due to defective emergence of the first definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the aorto-gonadal-mesonephros (AGM) region. In adult mice, inducible Runx1 deficiency results in blocked megakaryocyte (Mk) maturation, impaired lymphopoiesis, myeloid cell hyperproliferation, and progressive HSC exhaustion. Similar defects are seen with CBFbeta deficiency.
