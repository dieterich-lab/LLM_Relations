As described in this study, SphK1, which is the enzyme that catalyzes S1P formation, plays an essential role in this criss-cross transactivation phenomenon. We have previously shown that E2 stimulates SphK1, resulting in both a rapid, transient response and a delayed but prolonged activation. Although the latter response relies on ER transcriptional activity, the E2-induced rapid activation of SphK1 appears to be necessary for E2 cytoplasmic signaling, such as intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and ERK1/2 activation. In addition, cellular SphK activity has been functionally linked to the E2-dependent mitogenic and carcinogenic action in human breast cancer, suggesting an important signaling role of SphK1 in the biological function of E2. Indeed, SphK1, serving as an agonist-activated signaling enzyme, has been implicated in a wide spectrum of agonist-driven cellular responses, including cell survival, motility, proliferation, and differentiation. This pleiotropic action of SphK1 is attributed to its product, S1P, which functions as both an intracellular second messenger and a ligand for cell-surface receptors.
