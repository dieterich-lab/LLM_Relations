Since necrosis of infected cells promotes bacterial dissemination, the utilization of TNT's NAD+-glycohydrolase activity is highly advantageous for Mtb compared to ADP-ribosylating toxins of other bacterial pathogens that trigger apoptosis. TNT may also enable Mtb to control the timing and mode of cell death in other cell types such as neutrophils and dendritic cells, which Mtb is known to invade. However, the toxicity of TNT is also detrimental to Mtb. To protect itself from from self-poisoning, Mtb produces the immunity factor IFT (Fig. 2). The atomic structure of the TNT-IFT complex presented in this study reveals a fully electrostatic binding interface, which ensures picomolar binding affinity between these two proteins and may enable disassembly of IFT in the phagosome at acidic pH. TNT has similar catalytic activity as the SPN glycohydrolase of group A streptococci and a similar protective mechanism, although TNT and IFT lack identifiable sequence and structural similarities with proteins of known function. Although functionally equivalent, TNT and SPN differ in at least three ways. First, TNT is significantly smaller (~150 versus 450 residues) and represents one of the smallest NAD+-binding domain identified to date. Second, TNT has ~160-fold slower catalytic turnover of NAD+, but similar substrate affinity (Supplementary Table 1), possibly resulting in slower toxicity kinetics in vivo. Finally, the secretion mechanisms of TNT and SPN differ greatly. While a signal peptide is sufficient to secrete SPN across the membrane of S. pyogenes, TNT constitutes the C-terminal domain of the outer membrane protein CpnT which resembles autotranporters of Gram-negative bacteria. In the Pfam database, TNT is annotated as a member of the Domain of Unknown Function 4237, which comprises over 600 homologs encompassing approximately 300 bacterial and fungal species. Thus, our results identify a class of novel toxins present in a large group of microorganisms including many mycobacteria, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia pestis, which are known to induce necrosis of infected host cells. In conclusion, our study revealed the structure and enzymatic activity of TNT as an NAD+ glycohydrolase that affects host cell fate on multiple levels. These findings have broad implications in microbial pathogenesis.
