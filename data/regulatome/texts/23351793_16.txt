Targeting of proteins to the primary cilium also involves regulation of proteins under the control of the GDP-GTP cycle. Rab8, one such protein, interacts with the CTS of fibrocystin, as suggested by a study using a GFP fusion of the fibrocystin CTS. This GFP-CTS localizes to primary cilia in cells expressing Flag-Rab8 and Flag-Rab8Q67L (a constitutively active form of Rab8a having decreased GTPase activity, thereby maintaining the protein in the GTP bound state), but not Flag-Rab8T22N (a dominant negative form of Rab8 having a higher affinity for GDP than GTP) expressing cells. Rab8T22N bound more GFP-CTS than either the wild type or the Q67L mutant, suggesting that activation of Rab8 results in the release of the GFP-CTS from Rab8. Therefore, the regulation of Rab8 activity controls the localization of fibrocystin through its CTS. Whether other ciliary localizing proteins containing CTSs interact with Rabs through their CTS, remains to be determined.
