Hepatoma cells subjected to ORP10 silencing displayed a significant increase in the incorporation of [3H]acetate into cholesterol and of [3H]acetate and [3H]oleic acid into TG, suggesting that the intrinsic function of ORP10 involves suppression of hepatocellular lipid biosyntheses. Consistent with this observation, the cells showed increased HMG-CoA reductase activity, demonstrating an effect already at an early stage of the pathway, on conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. An independent, systematic esiRNA silencing screen of all ORP family members carried out in HeLa cells supported a role of ORP10 in the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis (data not shown). Labeling with [3H]oleic acid suggested that the impact of ORP10 on TG biosynthesis occurs at the levels of fatty acid activation or acyl transfer to glycerol. Importantly, we also found that ORP10 silencing enhances the accumulation of apoB100 in the hepatoma cell growth medium. One can envision that ORP10 could affect the synthesis of TG and cholesterol as well as the assembly of TG-rich lipoproteins in the intestine and the liver, both tissues in which OSBPL10 mRNA is expressed abundantly.
