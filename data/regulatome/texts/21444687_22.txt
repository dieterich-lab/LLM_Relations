Insulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Munc18c in a PI3K-independent pathway. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were preincubated in serum-free media for 2 h with or without 100 nM wortmannin followed by 5-min insulin stimulation (100 nM) and subsequent preparation of cleared detergent cell lysates. Munc18c was immunoprecipitated (IP) from lysates, protein was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and tyrosine-phosphorylated (P-Tyr) and total Munc18c was detected by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-4G10 or PY20 antibodies and anti-Munc18c, respectively; this experiment was performed by reprobing of the same blot with both antibodies. Quantitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Munc18c/total Munc18c from at least three independent cell passages, with each experiment normalized to insulin stimulation minus wortmannin = 1.0. Insulin and wortmannin actions in lysates used for immunoprecipitation were validated by detection of phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt) content, relative to total Akt. Data represent means +/- SEM. Black lines indicate that intervening lanes have been spliced out.
