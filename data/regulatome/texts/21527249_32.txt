The role of SENP1 in desumoylation of SAFB1 was examined based on its known activities toward SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 modified proteins. In HEK293T cells co-expressing SAFB1 and either SUMO1 or SUMO3 the addition of SENP1 led to decreased levels of sumoylated SAFB1 (Figure 2C; lanes 4 and 7). Addition of a catalytically inactive mutant SENP1 (SENP1m) did not decrease levels of sumoylated SAFB1 (Figure 2C; lanes 4 and 7). These results indicate that SENP1 acts as the desumoylating enzyme for SAFB1.
