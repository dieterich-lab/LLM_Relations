MiR-608 directly targets RAC2 and BCL2L1 3'-UTRs. A, Representative results of RAC2/BCL2L1 IHC in PCa TMA which contained 60 pairs of PCa tissues and peritumoral tissues (PT). B, Statistical analysis of RAC2/BCL2L1 IHC in PCa TMA. C, Oncomine analysis of RAC2/BCL2L1 mRNA expression. The results are from Wallace's microarray data sets, which include 69 cases of PCa and 20 cases of normal prostate tissues. D, qRT-PCR and (E) western blot analysis were applied to determine the expression of RAC2/BCL2L1 after miR-608 overexpression in PCa cells. F, Representative results of RAC2/BCL2L1 IHC in the sections of the xenograft tumors of either miR-608 or NC treated nude mice. G, Segments of RAC2/BCL2L1 3'-UTR containing either the wild-type (RAC2 Wt/BCL2L1 Wt-1/BCL2L1 Wt-2) or the mutant-type (RAC2 Mut/BCL2L1 Mut-1/BCL2L1 Mut-2) miR-608 binding sites. H, Dual-luciferase reporter assay. The relative luciferase activity is presented as the ratio of the activity of firefly luciferase to that of Renilla luciferase. Error bars represent SD from three independent experiments. *P < .05
