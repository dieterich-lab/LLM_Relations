The pathway by which PCSK9 directs LDLRs from endosomes to lysosomes has not been molecularly characterized. Several integral membrane proteins, including receptors such as EGFR, MHC class 1 molecules, and transporters such as ABCA1, are delivered from endosomes to the multivesicular bodies and then lysosomes by ESCRTs. Studies in yeast and selected mammalian cells have identified several components of the ESCRT machinery. Cargo recognition is mediated by the HRS/STAM complex (ESCRT-0) as well as ESCRT-I, which includes TSG101, VPS28, Vps37, and Mvb12. In the present study, simultaneous depletion of HRS and TSG101 disrupted the ESCRT pathway, as indicated by the inhibition of EGF-stimulated EGFR degradation in Hela cells (Fig. 6) and the enlargement of early endosomes in HEK293 cells (Fig. 7), but failed to block PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation in multiple cell types, including cultured hepatocytes (HuH7, HepG2), embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), and primary fibroblasts. The discordant responses of inactivation of the ESCRT pathway on EGFR degradation by EGF and LDLR degradation by PCSK9 is most consistent with the notion that the PCSK9-LDLR complex traffics to lysosomes independently of the ESCRT pathway, or at least ESCRT-0 or ESCRT-I. Recently, Dores et al. reported that PAR1, a G protein-coupled receptor, is trafficked to lysosomes via multivesicular bodies. Lysosomal trafficking of PAR1 did not require ubiquitination of the protein or the presence of HRS or TSG101. Knockdown of components of the ESCRT-III complex did prevent degradation of PAR1. Additional experiments are required to determine if PCSK9-LDLR complexes bypass ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I and use ESCRT-III to reach lysosomes.
