It has been thought that once promoter hypermethylation is established, it will be maintained during DNA replication due to an intrinsic ability of DNA methylransferases to recognize hemimethylated CpG residues and convert them to the fully methylated form. In support of this model are reports of interactions between DNA methyltransferases and DNA replication factors (see, for example,). However, we have found that knockdown of HOXB3, EZH2 or MYC results in loss of DNMT3B recruitment, decreased promoter methylation and RASSF1A de-repression. Likewise, we have previously shown that multiple factors are required to maintain hypermethyation of the epigenetically repressed Fas promoter, and our study and others have demonstrated an essential role for EZH2 in maintaining hypermethylation. Thus, at least in these instances, maintenance of promoter hypermethylation is not simply due to intrinsic DNA methyltransferase activity during DNA replication but instead requires continual recruitment of a DNA methyltransferase through a defined set of cofactors, which may differ depending upon both promoter and cell type (see, for example,).
