To further investigate the ability of the two crizotinib enantiomers to engage cellular proteins we derived chemical probes suitable for drug pull-downs (Supplementary Information). We tested the two derivatized compounds for their ability to target ALK and MTH1 in SW480 cell extracts. The two enantiomers were remarkably specific for their cognate targets (Fig. 2f). If MTH1 was indeed the key target of (S)-crizotinib in other RAS-transformed cells, it should rank at the top of the specific interactors in an unbiased chemical proteomic experiment as done before with SCH51344. MTH1 was by far the most specific and prominent interactor of (S)-crizotinib (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Plotting the chemical proteomic results of SCH51344 and (S)-crizotinib against each other singled out MTH1 as the only common high-significance interactor (Fig. 3a). We also performed the reciprocal analysis with (R)-crizotinib which identified a plethora of protein kinases, all efficiently competed by free drug, but not MTH1 (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Notably, comparison of both profiles did not reveal any proteins that were significantly bound by both enantiomers (Fig. 3b). To exclude that either crizotinib enantiomer may target kinases of low abundance we interrogated a panel of 456 different recombinant kinases (KINOMEscan, Extended Data Fig. 3). In line with the chemoproteomic results the two enantiomers displayed a remarkable stereoselectivity with very distinct profiles. The few kinases to which (S)-crizotinib showed some affinity were not calculated to be significantly inhibited. (R)-Crizotinib not only bound to ten times more kinases, but also was predicted to efficiently inhibit at least ten of them, including the well characterized cognate targets ALK, MET, but also LCK, IRAK1, JAK3, LOK and SLK. To understand the differences in MTH1 binding, we co-crystallised both (R)- and (S)-crizotinib with recombinant protein. The structure revealed an unfavourable eclipsed conformation of the methyl group at the chiral centre and the halogen substituents on the benzyl ring is likely to reduce the energetic favourability of (R)-crizotinib binding (Fig. 3c,d, Extended Data Fig. 4, 5). ITC data confirmed that the difference in binding between (R)- and (S)-crizotinib was entirely entropic and therefore not due to different binding interactions with the protein (Fig. 2b).
