In addition to importin-beta, a number of other Ran-binding proteins are detectable in eukaryotic cells, e.g., in overlay blots using Ran gamma-[32P]GTP as a probe. These can be grouped into two classes: first, those with a RanBP1 homology domain including the Ran binding protein 1 (RanBP1) itself and the nuclear pore protein RanBP2, which has four RanBP1 homology domains. Their binding to Ran can be competed by RanBP1. Second, importin-beta and so far unidentified protein(s) of ~120 kD whose Ran-binding is competed by importin-beta but not by excess of RanBP1. Both RanBP1 and importin-beta inhibit the nucleotide exchange on RanGTP. However, they do not cross-compete with each other for Ran binding but instead bind to different, nonoverlapping sites on Ran. Another striking difference is that RanBP1 facilitates the activation of Ran's GTPase by RanGAP1, whereas the importin-beta/RanGTP complex is entirely GAP resistant.
