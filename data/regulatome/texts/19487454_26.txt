The mammary stem/progenitor cell phenotype of Pygo2-deficient mice mirrors that in Wnt-activating mutants, raising the possibility that Pygo2 is involved in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in mammary epithelium. To address this, we first generated Pygo2-/- animals carrying a transgenic BAT-gal Wnt reporter gene that expresses beta-galactosidase at sites where canonical Wnt signaling is active. Strong beta-galactosidase expression was seen persistently in mammary rudiments of E11.5 to E15.5 Pygo2+/+/BAT-gal embryos, whereas expression was significantly reduced in Pygo2-/-/BAT-gal littermates (Fig. 5, A and B; and not depicted). The extent of reduction was greatest in mammary buds 2 and 3, correlating with their most severe morphological defects. We also examined the expression of Lef1, an endogenous Wnt/beta-catenin target. Normally, Lef1 is expressed in the developing mammary epithelium; however, in Pygo2-/- mammary buds, its mRNAs were barely detectable (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, the expression of another early mammary epithelial marker, Wnt10b, was unaffected (Fig. S4). Reduced Lef1 mRNA expression was also seen in postnatal mammary glands of Pygo2 SSKO mice (Fig. 5 D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Pygo2 is required in vivo for gene expression downstream of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.
