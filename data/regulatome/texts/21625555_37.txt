In conclusion, we demonstrate evidence for a new channel that lets water flow in and out of the active site of SET9. The channel and p53-K372 radii were measured to determine whether the water is able to pass through the first potential channel. The result excluded this channel, and indicated that there was another new channel for water movement. During the equilibration phase of the MD simulation, we observed that the water circulated through the new channel which still stayed open with AdoHcy or AdoMet bound. In addition, the radius changes of the first impossible channel and the new water channel at constant temperature prove that the water will choose the new channel for circulation. It is reasonable to believe that there exists the same new water channel for SET9 with histone H3, since the substrate regions of H3 and p53 have similar conformations and the second methyl positions are both occupied by the water at the active site of SET9.
