It was proposed that MyD88 and TRIF recruitment to the TIR domain of TLR4 is sequential and mutually exclusively. Consistent with cIAP2 recruitment to TLR4 being MyD88-dependent, immunoprecipitation of the membrane fraction with an cIAP2 antibody resulted in isolation of TLR4 and MyD88, but not TRIF (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Furthermore, inhibition of TLR4 endocytosis with the dynamin inhibitor dynasore had no effect on MyD88 or cIAP2 recruitment to the receptor, but blocked TRIF recruitment (Supplementary Fig. 4b). We conclude that TRIF and MyD88 are recruited to separate pools of receptors. As SM inhibits the dissociation of MyD88 from the receptor without affecting TRIF recruitment, whereas dynasore inhibits TRIF recruitment without affecting MyD88 recruitment, it appears that each adaptor is independently recruited to TLR4.
