These results correlate with the induction in alphavbeta3 activation observed when cells are adherent to S1 antibody (Fig. 2 C) and suggest that alphavbeta3 activation depends on S1 being engaged by ligand. To test this, integrin activation and expression was examined in S1-overexpressing cells in suspension (+/- mS1 clustering) and when adherent to S1 antibody. On suspended cells when mS1 is not clustered, we detect no increase in alphavbeta3 activity (Fig. 7 D, WOW1). However, when mS1 is clustered using mAb 281.2, although we detect no change in alphavbeta3 expression (Fig. 7 B, mAb LM609), we do detect a demonstrable increase in alphavbeta3 activity with either mS1 or GPI-mS1ED (unpublished data), but not with mS1Delta88-252 (Fig. 7 E, WOW1). Activation of the integrin with 1.0 mM Mn2+ is shown for comparison (Fig. 7 C); this contrasts with the diminished WOW1 binding observed following inactivation of the integrin by the removal of divalent cations (Fig. 7 C, CMF-PBS).
