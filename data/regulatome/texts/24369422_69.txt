L3MBTL2 is a subunit of the E2F6.com1 and the non-canonical PRC1.6 complex. Both complexes contain the heterodimeric transcription factors E2F6/DP1 and MGA/MAX, the latter binding to E-box and T-box motifs. Our motif search at the peak centre of the L3MBTL2-binding sites did not detect a strong association with E2F6-binding sites but with the E-box (CACGTG), which might indicate recruitment of L3MBTL2 through binding of MGA/MAX to DNA.
