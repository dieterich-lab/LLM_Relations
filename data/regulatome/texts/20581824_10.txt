Dilute solutions of purified human Rev-erbalpha (281-614Delta324-422) complexed with 2-3 molar excess of NCoR CoRNR1 peptide (2045 NH2- THRLITLADHICQIITQDFAR -OH 2065) concentrated to 5-6 mG per mL were used to obtain diffraction grade crystals. Vapor diffused hanging drops at 22degreesC with a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of the Rev-erbalpha NCoR complex and the precipitant solution produced 100-200 microM crystals within a few days. Precipitant solutions contained 6-9% PEG 3350, 8% glycerol, 200 mM proline, and 80 mM HEPES at pH 7.5. Prior to flash freezing in liquid N2, the crystals were transiently mixed with a cryoprotectant solvent consisting of the precipitant solution amended with 20% glycerol. X-ray diffraction data at 100degreesK from a single crystal data were collected at a 1Aa wavelength using a MAR165 detector at the IMCA-CAT, sector 17ID at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron. HKL2000 was used to index, integrate and scale the data. The structure was solved using a proprietary liganded Rev-erbalpha NCoR structure solved to 1.9Aa with heavy atom phases (to be published). A search model derived from hVDR (1db1) lacking helix 12 also yielded a valid solution by molecular replacement with AMORE or MOLREP. The resulting structure contains one molecule in the asymmetric unit that forms a symmetric dimer along helix alpha10 with an adjacent molecule. The initial model was iteratively built with Quanta (Accelrys) and refined with CNX and the final structure built with COOT and refined with Refmac using all hydrogens and maximum likelihood restraints. The crystallographic data and final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Reported interatomic distances are between heavy atoms unless specified and were measured with COOT or PyMol. The COOT SSM utility was employed to superimpose previously published structures upon the Rev-erbalpha monomeric LBD. The deposited coordinates have a MolProbity structure quality score of 1.89 (98%) and Ramachandran analysis within COOT reported that 191 residues are in the preferred, 4 in the allowed and 2 in the outlier regions. Structure figures were generated with PyMol from Delano Scientific (www.pymol.org).
