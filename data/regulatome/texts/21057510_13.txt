Since IL-27p28 can antagonize the ability of IL-6 to promote TH17 differentiation or IL-10 production, we initially hypothesized that IL-27p28 alone could act in a manner analogous to IL-27 and induce STAT signaling to mediate these effects. As IL-6 and IL-27 primarily activate STAT1 and STAT3, the ability of IL-27p28 to induce phosphorylation of these proteins in CD4+ T cells was assessed. A 15-minute incubation with IL-6 or IL-27 resulted in phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, while IL-27p28 alone did not induce STAT phosphorylation (Fig. 2a). This result was consistent at multiple time points examined over a two-hour period (data not shown). As IL-6 and IL-27 signal through gp130, an alternative explanation for the inhibitory effects of IL-27p28 is competition with IL-6 for binding to gp130. Therefore, the induction of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation by IL-6 in the presence of IL-27p28 was tested. Co-incubation of these two proteins led to a marked reduction in STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2a). A similar result was observed when IL-27p28 was incubated with IL-27 (Fig. 2a). This effect was dose dependent and typically required a 5- to 50-fold excess of IL-27p28 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Furthermore, phosphorylation of STAT3 by IL-11, a cytokine that utilizes gp130, but not IL-6Ralpha or IL-27Ralpha for signaling, was also reduced by addition of IL-27p28 (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Moreover, when CD4+ T cells were incubated with hyper-IL-6, a fusion protein consisting of human IL-6 and sIL-6Ralpha that can signal in trans through gp130 (ref.), phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 occurred and this signaling was antagonized by inclusion of IL-27p28 (Fig. 2b). It should be noted that the ability of IL-12, which does not signal through gp130, to phosphorylate STAT4 was not blocked by IL-27p28 (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
