This is a first report that provides evidence for Stat-dependent regulation of Jmjd3 expression during LPS-induced inflammatory responses. (Fig. 3b); however, NF-kappaB also participates in the transcriptional regulation of Jmjd3. The effects of Stat1 and Stat3 silencing or the ectopic expression of persistently activated Stat1 and Stat3 on inflammation-related genes are much stronger than the changes induced by Jmjd3 silencing or overexpression. This suggests that Stat1 and Stat3 contribute to the induction of gene expression not only through Jmjd3 activation but also by regulating transcriptional changes themselves (Fig. 3). Forced Jmjd3 expression in microglial cells resulted in minor effects on the mRNA levels of inflammatory genes and a modest effect on inflammatory cytokine production (Fig. 4) compared to LPS or Stat overexpression. However, Jmjd3 cooperated with the constitutively active Stat1C and Stat3C to upregulate the mRNA levels of inflammatory genes and cytokine production to levels comparable to those observed following LPS stimulation (Fig. 4). These results suggest that Jmjd3 cooperates with Stat1 and Stat3 to additionally alter the expression level. Although data regarding Jmjd3 DNA-binding sites in LPS-stimulated rat microglial cells are not available, computational comparison of our Stat binding data and Jmjd3 binding data from LPS-stimulated mouse intraperitoneal macrophages reveals a significant correlation (p < 10-12). This suggests that similar target genes are regulated by Stat1, Stat3, and Jmjd3, which cooperate to fully activate transcriptional responses during the inflammatory response.
