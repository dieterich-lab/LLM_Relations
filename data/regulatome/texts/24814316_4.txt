The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) MET is activated by its ligand the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and is a potent regulator of morphogenesis and migration, during development and in response to tissue injury in the adult. MET activation induced by receptor overexpression, genetic amplification, mutation, or increased HGF secretion is frequently observed in cancer cells. HGF stimulation results in MET activation and subsequent phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues that regulate the recruitment of adaptor proteins, MET internalization, transient endosomal signaling, and MET receptor trafficking toward either degradation or recycling back to the membrane. In cancer, activating mutations in MET or gain-of-function mutants of p53 induce sustained MET recycling, promoting tumorigenesis and invasion. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating MET turnover is critical.
