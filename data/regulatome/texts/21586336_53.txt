Only limited information exists about potential REHs in various tissues throughout the body. The uptake of dietary retinoids in skeletal muscle was shown to be dependent on LPL expression levels (see also Extracellular retinyl ester hydrolases). Yet, intracellular retinoid concentrations did not correlate with postprandial uptake suggesting that acquired free retinol is either immediately released into the circulation or first re-esterified and only then mobilized again. The latter step requires action of intracellular REH(s). HSL is known to play an important role in skeletal neutral lipid metabolism and has been shown to hydrolyze REs. Hence, it may be speculated that HSL mobilizes RE stores in skeletal muscle. However, direct data for this hypothesis and the physiological importance of skeletal muscle RE mobilization are lacking.
