These results suggest that Wnt signaling and GSK3 activity are regulators of the half-life of many cellular proteins. Some of the novel putative GSK3 targets listed in Table S2, HDAC4 and JunB, were tested and found to be stabilized by Wnt treatment (Figure S6B-S6E). In addition, the half-life of Smad4 was also regulated by Wnt, resulting in increased TGFbeta signaling (H. Demagny and E.M.D.R., in preparation). Testing all possible Wnt/GSK3 targets would be a daunting task, so we took a different approach, generating an artificial protein that serves as a biosensor of Wnt/GSK3activity.
