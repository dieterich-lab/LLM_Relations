Using anti-Rfc2 antibody (Ab) affinity chromatography followed by Q-sepharose chromatography, a RHR-loading activity that contained RFC, Rad17, and Ctf18, as well as several other proteins, was purified from human RKO cell extracts (V. E. and B. S., unpublished data). This partially purified fraction was found to load RHR onto primer template DNA substrates in a nucleotide-dependent manner, and RHR-loading activity required the Rad17 protein, since removal of Rad17 (and with it some Rfc2-5) using a monoclonal Ab against Rad17 rendered the fraction inactive. In contrast, removal of RFC using a monoclonal Ab against its Rfc1 subunit did not impair RHR loading (data not shown). To further define the components of the RHR-loading activity, an Ab against a Rad17 C-terminal peptide was developed that was able to immunoprecipitate (IP) specifically Rad17 along with the four small subunits of RFC, Rfc2, Rfc3, Rfc4, and Rfc5, but not the largest subunit, Rfc1 (data not shown). Coimmunoprecipitate of Rfc2-5 was not observed with preimmune serum, nor when the anti-Rad17 Ab was preincubated with the Rad17 peptide that was used as the antigen, indicating that recovery of the precipitated proteins required the epitope recognized by the Ab (data not shown).
