Since, CAND1 deficiency did not phenocopy CSN deficiency with regards to the control of FBP levels and stability, we wondered whether it affected the recruitment of FBPs to Cul1p. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that binding of Pof1p to Cul1p was strongly enhanced in a knd1 mutants (Fig. 6D). Consistent with CAND1 being displaced from fully neddylated Cul1p, this interaction was also enhanced in a csn5 deletion strain, in particular when accounting for the low steady-state levels of Pof1p present in this mutant (Fig. 6D). Whereas the Pof7p-Cul1p interaction was unaffected by the absence of Knd1p, the Pof3p-Cul1p interaction was substantially decreased (Fig. 6E). Knd1 mutants carrying C-terminally tagged Pof3p showed the same slow growth and cell elongation phenotype as described for pof3 deletion strains, indicating that they have a defect in SCFPof3p function (Fig. 6F). These phenotypes were neither observed in wildtype cells carrying tagged Pof3p nor in knd1 mutants harbouring tagged Pof7p (Fig. 6F), suggesting that the pof3-13myc allele is partially defective and therefore requires CAND1 to maintain a sufficient level of activity. Taken together, these findings show that loss of CAND1 differentially affects the composition of CRL1 complexes, presumably by allowing increased recruitment of some abundant FBPs such as Pof1p at the expense of less abundant adapters such as Pof3p.
