In terms of DSB repair, a useful approach would be to reconstitute DNA end resection with FANCJ and its interacting proteins (BLM, BRCA1, RPA, and MRN (our unpublished data)) along with structure-specific nucleases (DNA2, EXO-1). These efforts will be significantly enhanced if chromatinized templates are used to better reflect the in vivo situation. Cell-based studies with defined substrates should provide a better understanding of FANCJ's role in DNA end resection and how its interaction with BLM is important. Genetic and cell biological experiments will be required to confirm and extend observations from biochemical studies.
