Heterotrimeric G proteins consisting of multiple isoforms of distinct Galpha, beta and gamma subunits mediate the actions of a wide variety of cell surface receptors. Receptors catalyze exchange of tightly bound GDP for GTP on the alpha subunit in a process that requires the complete heterotrimer. In the classical model for G protein signaling, binding of GTP results in activation of the G protein and dissociation of the Galpha subunit from the Gbetagamma subunits (Fig. 1A). In recent years, a variety of reports have suggested additional modes of activation that could either add complexity to the classical model or represent entirely independent mechanisms for heterotrimeric G protein regulation. Whatever the mode of G protein activation, the Galpha and Gbetagamma subunits both interact with effector molecules, such as phospholipases and ion channels, in a manner that leads to their activation. Gbetagamma does not have a catalytic site and thus acts as a modulator of G protein signaling through regulated protein-protein interactions. The list of molecules that have been reported to bind to Gbetagamma continues to grow. While great progress has been made in the understanding of Gbetagamma structure and function, fundamental mechanisms for molecular recognition and effector regulation by Gbetagamma have yet to be fully elucidated. Additionally, how all these interactions are coordinated to mediate various G protein signaling processes in cells and tissues is not entirely clear. In this review we will discuss general background concerning Gbetagamma structure and function with an emphasis on new and emerging mechanisms and approaches for studying Gbetagamma signaling. These new data are leading to a greater understanding of how Gbetagamma functions at a mechanistic level and at a coordinated physiological level in cells and tissues. Together, this information could establish a basis for development of future therapeutic interventions.
