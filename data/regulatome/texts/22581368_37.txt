In this review, we have mainly paid attention to the localization and role of mammalian Rab6, Rab33B, Rab1, Rab2, Rab43, Rab18 and the comparable yeast proteins, Ypt1, Ypt32, and Ypt6. Each Rab protein significantly affects/regulates vesicular trafficking to/through the Golgi apparatus. Much of the affects of these proteins on Golgi organization can be explained on the basis of their effect on vesicular trafficking. Whether effects on Golgi stack interlinking into a Golgi ribbon in mammalian cells is due to the same process is uncertain. Stack interlinking likely requires separate, non-trafficking effectors; the recruitment of structural proteins such as golgins/GRASPs may be important. In mammalian cells, recent evidence points to Rab6 as being a significant regulator of Golgi cisternal number, perhaps by inhibiting COPI-coated vesicle trafficking. Whether other Rab proteins in mammalian cells regulate cisternal number as well as vesicle trafficking accumulation remains an open question. Although a large number of effectors have been identified for many of these Rab proteins, how mechanistically effectors and Rab proteins are linked to produce specific and selective variations in Golgi trafficking/organization is still not clear. This will be a challenge for future work.
