To identify the specific GEFs involved in the NRG1 regulation of Rac1 and Cdc42, we designed siRNA against Tiam1 and Dbs, major GEFs of the Dbl family for Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively, in Schwann cells. Neither Tiam1 nor Dbs knockdown had any effect on the NRG1-induced migration of Schwann cells (Fig. S1, A and B). Therefore, we examined the involvement of Dock7, a Dock180-related GEF expressed abundantly in Schwann cells (Fig. S1 C). Transfection of nonoverlapping siRNA, Dock7-1 or Dock7-2, into Schwann cells knocked down the expression of endogenous Dock7, as revealed by immunoblotting with an anti-Dock7 antibody (Fig. S2, A-C). Dock7-1 or -2 siRNA inhibited the NRG1-induced migration in Boyden chambers by ~70 and 50%, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B), as well as inhibiting migration from reaggregates on DRG axons (videos 9 and 10 for cells transfected with Dock7-1 siRNA, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709033/DC1). Similarly, knockdown of Dock7 by Dock7-1 siRNA reduced the NRG1 activation of Rac1 by ~80%, Cdc42 by 80%, and JNK phosphorylation by 60% (Fig. 4, C-E). Despite the potential involvement of other GEFs in these signaling pathways, our results hint at the possible role for Dock7 in Schwann cell migration and provide the rationale and impetus for the subsequent experiments.
