We next asked if there was a correlation between timing of the Cdk7 execution point and the Cdk7-dependence of various Rb phosphorylation marks, in Cdk7as/as cells subjected to the same synchronization and drug-treatment regimen and harvested 12 hr after release. When 3-MB-PP1 was added prior to the execution point, phosphorylations on both Cdk4/6- and Cdk2-specific sites were diminished. Passage through the execution point correlated with the loss of 3-MB-PP1-sensitivity of Rb phosphorylation at the Cdk4/6-dependent sites Ser807/811 and Ser795, whereas the Cdk2-specific sites at Thr821/826 remained sensitive for at least 9 hr after release (Figure 2C). This indicated a temporal correlation between the requirement for Cdk7 and a specific readout of Cdk4/6 activity, and suggested that the stronger G1 block due to inhibition of Cdk7, relative to Cdk2, might be due to the additional loss of Cdk4/6 activation.
