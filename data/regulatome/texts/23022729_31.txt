We reasoned that an understanding of the structural basis for the UHRF1 TTD insensitivity to H3S10p might allow us to uncouple UHRF1 from mitotic chromatin and explore its potential mitotic function. We showed previously that UHRF1 recognizes H3K9me3-containing histone peptides via its TTD with H3K9me3 sitting in the canonical aromatic cage. To explain mechanistically the lack of sensitivity of UHRF1 towards the presence of H3S10p, we first obtained a crystal structure of the TTD in a complex with a short H3 peptide (residues 6-11, TARKme3SpT). While we were able to observe clear electron density for the H3K9me3 residue that fits in the aromatic cage, the electron density for the adjacent H3S10p residue was weak, suggesting multiple conformations of this side chain (data not shown).
