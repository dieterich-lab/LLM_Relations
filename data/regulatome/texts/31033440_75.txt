Hyporesponsiveness to Epo therapy is commonly encountered in ID. Our recent studies provide evidence that HRI-ISR constitutes one feedback mechanism of erythroid homeostasis in ID. We show here that Grb10 is probably one of the ATF4 target genes involved in inhibiting Epo-mTORC1 signaling in ID. The increased proliferation of differentiating erythroblasts upon knockdown of Grb10 is consistent with the growth suppressor function of Grb10. In hematopoiesis, Grb10 regulates the self-renewal and regeneration of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Grb10-deficient HSCs exhibit increased proliferation that is dependent on the SCF-AKT/mTORC1 pathway, consistent with our Grb10 knockdown results. Grb10 has also been shown to be a GATA2 target gene and to play a role in the transition from BFU-E to CFU-E. Our results support an additional role of ATF4-induced Grb10 expression in terminal erythropoiesis in which GATA2 expression is low.
