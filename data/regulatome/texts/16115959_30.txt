Src family kinases are key components of outside-in integrin signaling to the actin cytoskeleton in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. In particular, c-Src, the most abundant Src family member that is expressed in platelets, can bind directly to the integrin beta3 subunit, and fibrinogen binding to alphaIIbbeta3 triggers c-Src activation. We sought to determine the mechanism by which fibrinogen binding leads to c-Src activation and explore the physiological significance of this process. The results establish that (1) fibrinogen binding to platelets leads to PTP-1B recruitment to an alphaIIbbeta3-based signaling complex that includes c-Src and Csk; (2) recruitment of PTP-1B is required for the dissociation of Csk from the complex, dephosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 529, and c-Src activation; (3) PTP-1B is required for alphaIIbbeta3-dependent platelet spreading on fibrinogen and for normal fibrin clot retraction but not for the agonist-induced activation of alphaIIbbeta3; and (4) deficiency of PTP-1B results in defective platelet thrombus formation in an in vivo model of vascular injury.
