The composition of the exocyst is highly conserved in eukaryotic systems, with eight single-copy subunits: Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84. Six of the eight subunits were identified in the original S. cerevisiae screen for secretory mutants and all but SEC3 are essential genes in yeast. Since the identification of the complex, budding yeast has proved to be a powerful tool for elucidating functional and structural information about the exocyst complex. Moreover, homologues of all the subunits exist in multicellular eukaryotes and the essential role for the complex in growth and development is conserved as well. Null mutants in a number of exocyst subunits result in early lethality in both mice and Drosophila indicating a critical role in development.
