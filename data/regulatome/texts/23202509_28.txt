ORF6 is a type I IFN antagonist, and its expression suppresses the induction of both IFN as well as the IFN signaling pathways. The protein inhibits IFN signaling by interacting via its C-terminal region to the nuclear import protein, karyopherin alpha2, thereby sequestering it in the cytoplasm and indirectly preventing movement of signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1 (STAT1) to the nucleus; the 18 a.a. N-terminus is also required for maximal inhibition and this inhibition probably plays a role in the immune evasion of SARS-CoV. ORF9b immunoprecipitated with ORF6 from extracts of SARS-CoV infected cells and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis reveal an interaction of the two in biologically relevant conditions. This interaction has been validated by co-localization of both proteins in the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV infected cells. Taken together, findings support the hypothesis that ORF6 could be a minor structural protein and could be an important virulence factor during SARS-CoV infection in vivo.
