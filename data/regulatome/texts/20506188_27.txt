RUNX1 is required for transcription of multiple hematopoietic-specific target genes and SWI/SNF is required for chromatin remodeling. Therefore, we assessed whether these events may be mechanistically coupled through protein-protein interactions. The association of RUNX1 with core subunits of the human SWI/SNF complex was examined by biochemical assays. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were carried out with endogenous RUNX1 and the SWI/SNF components BRG1, INI1 and BAF155 in Jurkat cells. Immuno-complexes obtained with RUNX1 antibody clearly reveal that RUNX1 associates with the three SWI/SNF subunits (Figure 2A). To validate these results, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays with antibodies raised against BRG1 and INI1 were performed. Indeed, RUNX1 is present in immuno-precipitates obtained with either antibody (Figure 2B). These results demonstrate that the RUNX1 protein associates with the human SWI/SNF complex.
