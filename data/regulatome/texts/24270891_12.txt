To further validate regulation of PTEN protein by USP13, we performed loss-of-function analysis in multiple cell lines that express abundant USP13 and PTEN protein levels. Two independent USP13 shRNAs both decreased PTEN protein expression by 80% and increased phospho-AKT and phospho-FOXO1/3 levels by 3- to 5-fold in SUM159 breast cancer cells, while restoration of PTEN or expression of an RNAi-resistant 'silence mutant' (i.e., no amino acid change) of USP13 (USP13-RE) in USP13-depleted SUM159 cells completely reversed the effect of USP13 shRNA on upregulating the phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. S2c, d). Similarly, depletion of USP13 downregulated PTEN protein and upregulated AKT and FOXO1/3 phosphorylation in MCF10A (Fig. 1e) and MCF7 (Fig. 1f) mammary epithelial cells and in HCT116 colon cancer cells (Fig. 1g), but not in the isogenic PTEN-null HCT116 cells (Fig. 1g). In addition, USP13 shRNA potentiated insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation in SUM159 cells, which could be reversed by re-expression of PTEN (Supplementary Fig. S2e). We conclude from these data that USP13 inhibits AKT signaling through positive regulation of PTEN protein. It should be noted that neither knockdown nor overexpression of USP13 affected PTEN mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S3a, b). Thus, USP13 does not regulate PTEN expression at the transcriptional level.
