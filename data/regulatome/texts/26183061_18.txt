The ability of the EGF/PI3K/AKT axis to activate MKRN1, which might consequently induce PTEN destabilization, led us to investigate whether this signalling pathway could affect the ubiquitination status of PTEN. The ubiquitination of endogenous PTEN was considerably increased 24 h after EGF treatment, with simultaneous activation of the pAKT/MKRN1 axis (Fig. 7a). Notably, PTEN ubiquitination decreased upon AKT or MKRN1 ablation, indicating that EGF-driven PTEN ubiquitination is pAKT- and MKRN1 dependent (Fig. 7b,c). Consistent with these observations, overexpression of Myr-AKT induced the endogenously ubiquitinated PTEN, which was suppressed in the absence of MKRN1 (Supplementary Fig. 9). The ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PTEN are mediated by several E3 ligases, including NEDD4-1 and WWP2 (refs). Thus, we examined whether other PTEN E3 ligases were involved in PTEN regulation similar to MKRN1. Consistent with the findings of previous studies, knockdown of either NEDD4-1 or WWP2 induced PTEN stabilization in ME-180 cells (Fig. 7d). siNEDD4-1 #3 and siWWP2 #5, which increased PTEN levels, were then used to determine whether NEDD and WWP2 are involved in PTEN regulation through EGF-mediated signalling pathways. Upon EGF exposure, only MKRN1 depletion fully interfered with the active EGF/PI3K/AKT axis-mediated ubiquitination of PTEN, whereas neither NEDD4-1 nor WWP2 had this effect (Fig. 7e). In addition, the known ubiquitination sites, K13 and K289, on PTEN by NEDD4 were tested for MKRN1's targeting. The results showed that MKRN1 could specifically target K289 but not K13 for ubiquitination. Supporting these data, MKRN1 could not mediate the degradation of K289R, implying that MKRN1 and NEDD4 have a common target site on PTEN (Supplementary Fig. 8e,f). Taken together, these results indicate that the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signal suppresses PTEN stability and activity through MKRN1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation.
