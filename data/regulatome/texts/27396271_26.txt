Based on the homology model of G12C K-Ras, Lim et al. designed a GDP analogue, SML-8-73-1 (SML, 1) (Fig. 5B), which has a high likelihood of forming a covalent inhibitor with Cys12. Subsequent mass spectroscopy (MS) experiments confirmed that SML was able to covalently modify G12C K-Ras, but did not label WT K-Ras. To further illuminate the binding mode between SML and G12C K-Ras, Hunter et al. solved the co-crystal structure of G12C K-Ras bound to SML (PDB ID 4NMM, Fig. 5C) as well as the structures of WT (PDB ID 4OBE) and G12C (PDB ID 4LDJ) GDP-bound K-Ras. Backbone superimposition of the crystal structures of K-RasG12C-GDP and K-RasWT-GDP onto that of K-RasG12C-SML exhibits that the overall conformation of K-Ras is extremely similar among three structures and that the orientation of SML in the active site of K-RasG12C is also nearly identical to those of GDP in the K-RasG12C and K-RasWT (Fig. 5D), ruling out the possibility that covalent modification of Cys12 by SML results in extensive conformational remodeling of the switch I and switch II regions. Thus, the resulting conformation of K-RasG12C is in the open, inactive conformation upon SML binding, which is incapable of interacting with downstream effector proteins. To test this hypothesis, the structure of K-RasG12C-SML was superimposed onto those of H-Ras-GppNHp in complex with the RBD of Raf kinase (Raf-RBD) (PDB ID 4G0N) and PI3Kgamma (PDB ID 1HE8), respectively. Remarkably, compared to the formation of exquisite salt bridge networks between the switch I region of H-Ras-GppNHp and Raf-RBD and PI3Kgamma, no salt bridges were formed between the switch I region of K-RasG12C-SML and Raf-RBD (Fig. 6A) and PI3Kgamma (Fig. 6B). Moreover, a steric conflict between the switch I region of K-RasG12C-SML and the beta-strands of Raf-RBD and PI3Kgamma was observed. Functional biochemical assay through the AlphaScreen technology was performed to assess the affinity between K-RasG12C-GppNHp/-GDP and Raf-RBD in the presence or absence of SML. The results showed that K-RasG12C-GppNHp strongly interacts with Raf-RBD with an EC50 of 6.6 nM, which has a higher affinity than the interaction between K-RasG12C-GDP and RafRBD with an EC50 of 22.6 nM. The AlphaScreen assay further revealed that the affinity of K-RasG12C-SML for RafRBD is nearly identical to that of K-RasG12C-GDP for Raf-RBD. These data suggest that SML binding to the active site of Ras is likely to prevent the activation of Ras downstream signaling.
