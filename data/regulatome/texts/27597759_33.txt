To further validate that PEX2 is responsible for the increased ubiquitination of peroxisomal membrane proteins, we examined whether overexpression of PEX2 resulted in an increase in ubiquitinated proteins on peroxisomes. To determine whether peroxisomal proteins were ubiquitinated, peroxisomes were isolated from the HEK293-HA-Ub stable cell line, which had been transiently transfected with either empty FLAG vector or PEX2-FLAG. Membranes were first isolated by centrifugation, and then fractionated into light, medium, heavy, and pellet fractions by density centrifugation. We found peroxisomes (PMP70) to be enriched in both the medium and heavy fractions, whereas the ER (calnexin) and mitochondria (MFN2) were enriched in only the medium fraction (Fig. 7 C). In both the medium and heavy fractions, we detected multiple HA-Ub bands in cells expressing PEX2-FLAG, but not in the cells transfected with empty vector, suggesting the expression of PEX2-FLAG causes an increase in the ubiquitination of peroxisomal membrane proteins (Fig. 7, C and D). These multiple ubiquitin signals further suggest that the PEX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity may be promiscuous against multiple peroxisomal membrane proteins.
