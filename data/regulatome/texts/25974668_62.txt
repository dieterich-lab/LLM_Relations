Interestingly, super-enhancers bound by Sox10 are associated with genes upregulated during myelination in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells (Table 1 & 2). One brain super-enhancer enriched with shared Sox10/H3K27ac coincides with several regulatory elements near the Sox10 locus, as well as with Olig2/Myrf binding in the CNS and Egr2 in the PNS (Figure S1B). Another super-enhancer around the Fa2h locus is bound by Sox10/H3K27ac and respective master regulators Olig2/Myrf/Egr2 (Figure S1C).
