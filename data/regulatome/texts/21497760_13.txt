We next analyzed endogenous retinoid activity in Hoxa1/Pbx1;RARE::lacZ null mutants by beta-gal staining. At 0-2 somite stage, beta-gal activity was severely downregulated in Hoxa1/Pbx1 null embryos (Figure 2D). By the 3-4 somite stage, the overall beta-gal staining levels were still significantly lower than in controls (Figures 2E and 2F). Moreover, the rostral LPM domain of retinoid activity diffusing into the heart field was either missing or severely reduced (double arrowheads), in agreement with Raldh2 in situ hybridization results (compare Figures 2B and 2F). Notably, the anterior boundary of beta-gal staining in the presumptive hindbrain was posteriorly shifted in Hoxa1/Pbx1 null mutants, as compared to controls (single arrowhead, Figures 2E and 2F). These data revealed that Hoxa1 and Pbx1 genetically interact in regulating early mesodermal Raldh2 expression and setting the RA activity boundary in the presumptive hindbrain neuroepithelium.
