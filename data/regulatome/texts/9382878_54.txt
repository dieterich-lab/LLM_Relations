Apparently, the expression of Ep-CAM leads to a decrease in the cytoskeleton-anchored fraction of E-cadherin molecules. To investigate whether some catenins were still associated with the detergent-soluble fraction of the E-cadherin molecules, the induced and noninduced LEC-MEp.6 cells were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100, and immunoprecipitations were performed from the extracts using antibodies specific to E-cadherin or beta-catenin (Fig. 9 B). Upon the induction of Ep-CAM in LEC-MEp.6 cells, there was a clear increase in the amount of beta-catenin coprecipitating with the detergent-soluble E-cadherin molecules (Fig. 9 B). The reverse precipitations with anti-beta-catenin mAb produced similar results, with increased coprecipitation of E-cadherin upon induction of Ep-CAM. However, when the immunoprecipitates of soluble E-cadherin were probed with anti-alpha-catenin antibody, no increased presence of alpha-catenin associated with this fraction of E-cadherin molecules was observed. The latter result was consistent with the observation of the decrease in total alpha-catenin content in the cells. Additionally, a certain increase in alpha-catenin molecules coprecipitating with beta-catenin was observed upon the induction of Ep-CAM (Fig. 9 B).
