Since Hedgehog signaling pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis and the prognosis of gastric cancer, targeting this pathway is a new potential therapeutic opportunity in gastric cancer. Vitamin D3 may act as an antagonist of hedgehog signaling to suppress viability of gastric cancer cells, and it also has a synergistic effect with other anticancer drugs by reducing mRNA expression of the target genes of hedgehog signaling ( Ptch1, Gli1, cyclin D1 and bcl2). Co-treatment with cisplatin and 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 enhanced cisplatin-mediated cell growth inhibition and cell apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells with an upregulation of Bax, a decrease in ERK and AKT phosphorylation levels, and an increase in p21 and p27 levels.
