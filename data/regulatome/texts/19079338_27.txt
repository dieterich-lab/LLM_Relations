IQGAP1 has been reported to promote cell motility via interactions with Rac1 and Cdc42. To test whether menin affects the IQGAP1-Rac1 interaction, we performed affinity pull-down assays to examine associations of menin, IQGAP1 and Rac1 (Fig. S6A). We precoated Ni-NTA agarose with His-tagged IQGAP1 and then subsequently incubated the coated beads with menin and activated or inactive Rac1. As expected, menin and GTPgammaS-Rac1 bound independently to IQGAP1 (lanes 4 and 6). The affinity of GDP-Rac1 to IQGAP1 was very low, slightly higher than its background binding to naked Ni-NTA agarose beads (lane 5 vs lane 2). However, GTPgammaS-Rac1 binding to IQGAP1 was substantially reduced in the presence of menin (lane 7). Thus, activated Rac1 and menin may competitively bind to IQGAP1. This conclusion was fortified by studies of live cells. Mock cells and menin-overexpressing cells were subjected to IPs and immunoblotting. Anti-Rac1 pulled down IQGAP1 but 2.8 fold less effectively in cells that ectopically expressed menin (Fig. S6B, C).
