There is broad agreement that FCHo acts early and it acts to stabilize nascent clathrin-coated pits via AP2. The AP2 complex associates with the plasma membrane with different lifetimes; some AP2 clusters are aborted rapidly (between 5-16 s) whereas others develop into fully committed pits (90 s). In the absence of FCHo, the lifetime of AP2 at the membrane in cultured cells is quite brief (<10 s), whereas overexpression of FCHo stabilizes AP2 and promotes the growth of clathrin-coated pits with long lifespans (>25 s). We observe a similar phenotype in fcho-1 mutants: although AP2 still associates with the plasma membrane, it does not form clusters. Moreover, the dwell time of AP2 on the membrane is shorter; in fcho-1 mutants worms, the lifespan of AP2 on the membrane is reduced from 35 to 10 s. These results are strikingly similar to the observations of Cocucci et al (2012).
