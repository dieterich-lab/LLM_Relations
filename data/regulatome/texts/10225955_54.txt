We have analyzed here the binding regions of l-afadin and nectin and found that the PDZ domain of l-afadin and the cytoplasmic regions of nectin directly interact with each other. PDZ domains are modular domains that bind to specific COOH-terminal peptide sequences. Many PDZ domain-containing proteins and their binding partners have been isolated recently, and peptide sequences for various PDZ domains have been reported. Using the oriented peptide library technique, PDZ domains are assigned into classes according to their peptide-binding specificities. The PDZ domain of AF-6 (s-afadin) is classified as the class II, selecting peptides with hydrophobic or aromatic aa residues at position -2 relative to the COOH terminus. The PDZ domain binds preferentially to a peptide which terminates in the sequence, E-F-Y-V. Nectin terminates in the sequence, E/A-X-Y-V (X indicates W, V, and M for nectin-1, -2alpha, and -2delta, respectively). Our finding is consistent with these earlier observations, but we have shown here by the yeast two-hybrid assay that the PDZ domain of l-afadin does not bind to neurexin-2alpha which terminates in the sequence, E-Y-Y-V. A recent study of the third PDZ domain of PSD-95/SAP90 indicates that X residues at position -1 in the consensus sequence (X-S/T-X-V) and the upstream residues of the tetrapeptide determine the specificity and affinity for the binding of the PDZ domain to its binding partner. By analogy, unique aromatic or hydrophobic X residues at position -2 in the sequence (E/A-X-Y-V), such as W, V, and M, may be necessary to bind to the PDZ domain of l-afadin. It is also possible that the upstream residues of the tetrapeptide are crucial for the specificity and affinity for the PDZ domain. It has been shown recently that the PDZ domain of AF-6 (s-afadin) binds to neurexin as well as the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family members, but this result is not consistent with ours and the reason for this discrepancy is not known at present.
