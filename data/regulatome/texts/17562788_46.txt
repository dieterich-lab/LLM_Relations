Some of the results presented here suggest that there are problems with the use of dominant-active GTP-locked Rabs. Although the expression of dominant-active Rab5Q79A results in the trapping of Shiga toxin in an early endocytic compartment, indicating its transport is Rab5 dependent, this interpretation is not supported by the use of specific Rab GAPs. Although RabGAP-5 does block EGF and transferrin trafficking, it has no effect on the transport of Shiga toxin to the Golgi (Fig. 6). This suggests that although Shiga toxin trafficking is normally Rab5 independent, when dominant-active Rab5 is expressed, it becomes trapped in the enlarged early endocytic compartment created under these conditions. One explanation for this could be that Shiga toxin, although normally trafficking in a Rab5-independent fashion, does pass through a Rab5-positive endocytic compartment, and this can also be perturbed by the overexpression of active mutant forms of Rab5. In contrast, EGF trafficking is blocked by both RabGAP-5 and Rab5Q79A (Figs. 2 and 6) and, therefore, does follow a Rab5-dependent pathway through early endosomes. Thus, dominant-active Rab5 appears to create a situation in which the function of the early endocytic pathway is perturbed such that molecules that normally traffic in a Rab5-independent manner are also affected. Dominant-active Rabs should therefore be used with some caution, and, as shown here, specific Rab GAPs provide valuable and specific tools to manipulate the activity of endogenous Rabs.
