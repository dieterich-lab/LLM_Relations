Previous studies have shown that growth factor-induced Raf dimerization is dependent on the Ras-Raf interaction as well as binding of 14-3-3 to a phosphorylation site in the C-terminus of the Rafs (B-Raf pS729, C-Raf pS621). Using phosphospecific antibodies, we were able to confirm that the dimer interface mutants were indeed phosphorylated on the C-terminal 14-3-3 binding site, indicating that the lack of dimerization for the R>H mutants was not due to a defect in the phosphorylation of this site (Figure S2A). Moreover, in co-immunoprecipitation assays, we observed no defect in the ability of the R>H-Raf mutants to bind other critical Raf interactors such as Ras, 14-3-3, Hsp90, or Cdc37 (Figure 2D), and by mass spectrometry analysis, the only difference observed for R>H-B-Raf was the lack of C-Raf binding (Figure 2E). These findings together with results from an in vitro binding assay using purified Raf proteins (Figure S1D), indicates that the R>H dimer interface mutation specifically disrupts Raf-Raf contact. Finally, we found that the increased dimerization and activation potential of the E>K mutants was still dependent on the phosphorylation of the Raf C-terminal 14-3-3 binding site, as mutation of this site (denoted as S>A) eliminated heterodimerization and activation by EGF treatment (Figure S2B,C).
