Hereditary PAP caused by abnormalities or absence of GM-CSF receptor alpha was reported in three children. One child developed progressive dyspnea of insidious onset by 3-4 years and diffuse lung disease and respiratory insufficiency by 6 years. Lung histopathology was similar to autoimmune PAP and GM-CSF deficient mice. However, GM-CSF autoantibodies were absent and GM-CSF levels were elevated in the lungs and serum. The GM-CSF receptor beta chain was present and had a normal nucleotide sequence. However, the alpha chain had a reduced molecular weight, abnormal glycosylation pattern, reduced GM-CSF binding, and impaired activation of STAT5. Karyotyping, genomic chromosomal hybridization, and high resolution SNP analysis revealed a 1.6 Mb deletion in the pseudo-autosomal region at Xp22.33 encompassing the maternal CSF2RA allele, and a point mutation (G196R) in the paternal CSF2RA allele that altered glycosylation of the GM-CSF receptor alpha peptide and markedly reduced GM-CSF binding. This child's asymptomatic 8-year-old sister had increased serum GM-CSF and SP-D (both markers of PAP lung disease severity) and subsequent radiological and pulmonary function abnormalities demonstrated she had PAP. A 4 year old child developed PAP in association with Turner's syndrome and loss of both CSF2RA alleles. Subsequent screening of pediatric patients with unexplained PAP (i.e., who were negative for GM-CSF autoantibody) for an elevated serum GM-CSF level resulted in identification of 5 additional patients aged 3-11 years of age with PAP caused by various CSF2RA mutations (B.C.T., unpublished results). Together, these cases indicate that loss of GM-CSF receptor function causes hereditary PAP, but that additional factors determine the severity of lung disease in PAP.
