Quantitative binding of rat brain dystroglycan to immobilized neurexin 1alpha analyzed by immunoblotting. Rat brain proteins were bound to columns containing immobilized Ig-N1alpha-1 or Ig-control proteins, washed twice in binding buffer (Wash 1 and 2), and eluted with 1.0 M NaCl, 5 mM EGTA (Elution). Identical amounts of the various fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting for alpha- and beta-dystroglycan and neuroligin 1. Note that dystroglycan is quantitatively depleted from the homogenates in the flow-through of the Ig-neurexin column, whereas neuroligin does not bind to neurexin 1alpha as shown previously. Numbers at the left in both panels indicate positions of molecular weight markers.
