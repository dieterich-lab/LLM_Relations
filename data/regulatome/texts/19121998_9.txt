Morpholino and Inhibitor Experiments--Morpholinos used to inhibit TPX2 expression during oocyte maturation were synthesized by Gene Tools, LLC (control morpholino, 5'-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3'; TPX2 morpholino, 5'-GTAGGTGTCCTGTGTATCTTCCATG-3'). Morpholinos were injected into resting Stage VI oocytes at a final concentration of 40 mum. Oocytes were incubated overnight and then stimulated or not with progesterone. Extracts of five oocytes were prepared in extraction buffer (80 mm beta-glycerophosphate, 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mum okadaic acid) either before progesterone stimulation or 2 h after germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD),3 when uninjected oocytes reached Meta II arrest. Proteins were resolved on Anderson gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. The ATP-competitive Aurora A kinase inhibitor, cyclo-propanecarboxylic acid {3-[4-(trifluoromethyl-phenylamino)-pyrimidin-2-ylamino]-phenyl}-amide, is from Sigma (C1368) and was injected into oocytes to a final concentration of 50 mug/ml. Progesterone (10 mug/ml) was added 30 min after injection, and extracts were prepared as described above.
