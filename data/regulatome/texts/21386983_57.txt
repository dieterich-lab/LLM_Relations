There is currently no literature suggesting a role of beta-Syn in relation to metal homeostasis. However, beta-Syn has been suggested to bind copper. A recent study has shown that it has similar affinity for copper as alpha-Syn and that the co-ordination of copper binding is similar. alpha-Syn not only binds copper but copper binding increases its aggregation and results in the formation of toxic oligomeric species that kill cells both exogenously and endogenously. As beta-Syn has been shown to decrease the aggregation of alpha-Syn, it is conceivable that this process might involve prevention of copper binding to alpha-Syn by either binding copper itself or a physical interaction with alpha-Syn that inhibits copper binding. Alternatively, beta-Syn might out-compete alpha-Syn for copper due to increased expression. In this study we showed that copper appears necessary for beta-syn promoter function, as well MTF-1 induction of the beta-Syn promoter. Indeed, MTF-1 has been shown to act as a copper-sensing transcriptional activator to regulate human prion gene expression, a protein also relevant to neurodegeneration. Increased expression/activity of MTF-1 in response to altered copper levels in the cell could conceivably result in increased levels of beta-Syn, protecting the cell from adverse copper binding by alpha-Syn that could lead to the formation of toxic copper binding oligomers.
