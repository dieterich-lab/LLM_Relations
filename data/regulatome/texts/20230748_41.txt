As distal appendages may also be important for docking of intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins during the process of ciliogenesis, we examined Ift recruitment. Two components of Ift complex B, Ift20 and Ift80, localized normally to centrosomes in Ofd1Gt cells (Figure 6A-B). Similarly, Kif3a, part of the anterograde Ift motor, localized to centrosomes in both wild type and Ofd1Gt cells (Figure 6C). Ift88, another Ift complex B component, is present at the centrosome and along the cilium. Immunofluorescence staining and quantification revealed that, in contrast to Ift20, Ift80 and Kif3a, Ift88 failed to associate with centrosomes in Ofd1Gt cells (Figure 6D-E). This defect is not due to differences in protein expression, as wild type and Ofd1Gt cells expressed Ift88 at similar levels (Figure 6F). Restoring Ofd1 protein expression in Ofd1Ofd1myc cells restored normal localization of Ift88 to the centrosome (Figure 6G-H). Together, these data suggest that loss of Ofd1 caused a specific loss of Ift88 from the centrosome.
