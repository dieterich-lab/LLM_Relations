In conclusion, Tysnd1-/- mice show reduced beta-oxidation and phytanic acid metabolism. The changes in the plasmalogen composition, which we consider a contributing factor, but not necessarily the cause of male infertility in Tynsd1-/- mice are thought to be secondary effects of altered cellular acyl-CoA pools mediated by the reduced beta-oxidation. Faulty peroxisomal targeting of novel Tysnd1 PTS2-containing substrates Phyh and Agps, and the previously reported substrate Acaa1 decreases their activities. Since Tysnd1 acts as a protease that affects the function of its substrates in the mouse model, we anticipate a new human peroxisomal disease entity caused by impaired TSYND1 functions that trigger a combination of mild dysfunctions among TYSND1 processing-dependent peroxisomal enzymes.
