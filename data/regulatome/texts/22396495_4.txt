NOTCH signaling has been shown to participate in cell fate determination and in progenitor cell maintenance during development. In mammals, there are four NOTCH receptors (NOTCH1-NOTCH4) which have distinct tissue expression patterns and are thought to function in specific cellular contexts. The NOTCH pathway is activated by receptor-ligand interactions on the cell membrane, which subsequently lead to a cascade of enzymatic cleavages of membrane NOTCH receptors by ADAM metalloprotease and gamma-secretase complex. The cleaved product, intracellular fragment of NOTCH (NICD), translocates into the nucleus where it interacts with the nuclear DNA-binding factor, CSL (RBPJk), and recruits co-activators to activate transcription of target genes. In addition to its role in the developmental processes, aberrant activation of the NOTCH pathway has emerged as a mechanism in the pathogenesis of a variety of human neoplastic diseases. For example, a tumor-promoting role of NOTCH1 has been reported in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) because activating point mutations of NOTCH1 involving the extracellular heterodimerization domain and/or the C-terminal PEST domain of NOTCH1 are present in more than half of T-ALLs.
