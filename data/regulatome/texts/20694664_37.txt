In vitro export assay utilizes digitonin to permeabilize cell plasma membranes for macromolecules, yet leave the nuclei structurally and functionally intact. Washing the permeabilized cells removes majority of the cytoplasmic proteins, which prevents the cytoplasmic Smad2/3 being imported into the nucleus again. Thus, the level of Smad2 in samples represents nuclear Smad2 that has not been exported. We use this assay to compare the effect of RanBP3 and its Ran-binding mutant RanBP3-wv (see Note 6) on Smad2 export.
