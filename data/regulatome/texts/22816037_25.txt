TGEV infects epithelial cells from the small intestine but is also able to infect cells from the respiratory tract. In the mid-1980s, an attenuated variant of TGEV, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) was isolated in Belgium. This virus provides an example of altered tissue tropism due to a deletion occurring in the spike gene. Unlike TGEV, PRCoV infects only pulmonary epithelial cells. Both spike proteins bind porcine APN, the receptor binding domain being located between residues 522 and 744 of TGEV S protein. The spike protein of TGEV has a hemagglutinating activity that is absent in PRCoV as this activity is contained in the deleted N-terminal part of the protein. One of the consequences of this lack of activity is the inability of PRCoV to replicate in the gut. The hemagglutinating activity was mapped to the residues 145-155 of TGEV spike protein and it has been shown that a mutation abrogating this activity reduced the enteropathogenicity of the virus. In addition, a study has shown that the sialic acid binding activity of TGEV is responsible for binding of an additional protein designated as mucin-like glycoprotein (MPG) in brush border membranes. It has been suggested that this binding might shield the virus from the action of gut emulsifiers. The role of the NTD and carbohydrate binding in TGEV provides interesting insights into coronavirus enterotropism, a property that generally is attributed to non-enveloped viruses. The role of the NTD in other enteric alphacoronaviruses such as FCoV and canine coronavirus (CCoV) is still unknown.
