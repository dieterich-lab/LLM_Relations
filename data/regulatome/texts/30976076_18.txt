We next investigated the effect of T6 phosphorylation on the kinetics of pyroptosis and caspase-3/7 activation in CEM-C7-knockout (KO) cells, stably reconstituted with WT or T6E mutant GSDME. As expected, cells expressing the T6E mutant GSDME exhibited diminished pyroptosis compared to WT cells or cells expressing WT GSDME in response to TA (Fig. 3a, e) or ultraviolet (UV; Fig. 3c, f) treatment as measured by PI uptake or release of HMGB1. The kinetics of PI uptake or HMGB1 release in T6E-expressing cells were comparable to those observed in GSDME-KO cells, confirming that T6 phosphorylation is critical for the pyroptotic activity of GSDME. Interestingly, cells expressing the T6E mutant also showed significant reduction in the kinetics and magnitude of caspase-3 activation in response to TA (Fig. 3b, e) or UV (Fig. 3d, f) treatment. This was also evident by reduced cleavage of the T6E GSDME mutant (Fig. 3e, f, 8th lane) compared to WT GSDME (Fig. 3e, f, 6th lane). These results indicate that the pore-forming activity of GSDME is not only required for pyroptosis but also required to enhance the kinetics and magnitude of caspase-3 activation in response to apoptotic stimuli.
