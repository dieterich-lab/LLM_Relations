The PETPVFRLT box located at the C terminus of ATM and it is conserved between ATM, ATR and DNA-PK. ATM, ATR and DNA-PK are all large proteins that belong to the phosphoinositde 3-kinase (PI(3)K) superfamily. The function of the PETPVFRLT box remains unclear. We generated 3 point mutations in the PETPERLT box, which including ATM2904, ATM2907 and ATM2908 (Fig. 2A). ATM 2907 mutation has been found in AT patient but the mechanism is not clear how ATM2907 cause the loss of ATM activity. After trans-fection of AT cells with ATM2904, ATM2907 and ATM2908, we detected normal ATM phosphorylation, P53 phosphorylation and H2AX phosphorylation (Fig. 2B) in all the mutants. But interestingly, the ATM2907 mutant showed IR radiation sensitivity and behaved like AT cells which lack ATM protein (Fig. 2D). To rule out the possibility of ATM expression and nuclear location change, we detected ATM level and expression by both Western blot and immunofluorescence, no detectable difference was detected between ATM full length transfected cells and these mutants (Fig. 2C and D). Our previous work showed that Tip60 acetyltransferase bind to ATM and make contribution to ATM activation, and C terminus of ATM could be the binding site of Tip60. So we detected ATM associated Tip60 HAT activity in these cells. We observed normal HAT activity in response to DNA damage in all the mutants and wide type cells, which indicate that the PET-PVFRLT box does not affect the association of Tip60 and ATM (Fig. 2E). These observations showed PETPVFRLT box play an important role for ATM activation but not autophosphorylation and it is not due to the binding to Tip60.
