To elucidate the role of N3 in squamous differentiation, we established two independent lines of EPC2-hTERT cells of stable N3 knockdown. The RNAi effect was validated by inhibition of Ca2+- or ICN1-mediated N3 mRNA and ICN3 protein induction (Figure 6A and B, and supplementary Figure 13A and B). N3 knockdown resulted in suppression of the IVL promoter activation as well as IVL mRNA and IVL protein induction (Figure 6B-D, and supplementary Figure 13B and C). Additionally, N3 knockdown suppressed HES5 and CK13 induction (Supplementary Figure 13D and E), implying N3 is involved in their transcriptional regulation. Moreover, in organotypic 3D culture, N3 knockdown impaired squamous epithelial stratification and IVL expression without affecting basal cell proliferation (Figure 6E). Interestingly, ICN1 was induced upon Ca2+ stimulation in N3 knockdown cells without circumventing the N3 knockdown effect upon IVL expression (Figure 6B). Given the role of N3 in IVL transcriptional activation, we carried out transient transfection of ICN1 and ICN3, either alone or in combination. ICN1, but not ICN3, activated the IVL promoter. However, ICN3 enhanced significantly the ICN1-mediated IVL promoter transactivation in EPC2-hTERT cells (Figure 6F). These findings indicate cooperation between N1 and N3 in squamous differentiation.
