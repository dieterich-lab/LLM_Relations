Expression of human alpha-l-fucosyltransferase gene homologs in monkey kidney COS cells and modification of potential fucosyltransferase acceptor substrates by an endogenous glycosidase.  Previous investigations on the monkey kidney COS cell line demonstrated the weak expression of fucosylated cell surface antigens and presence of endogenous fucosyltransferase activities in cell extracts. RT-PCR analyses have now revealed expression of five homologs of human fucosyltransferase genes, FUT1, FUT4, FUT5, FUT7, and FUT8, in COS cell mRNA. The enzyme in COS cell extracts acting on unsialylated Type 2 structures is closely similar in its properties to the alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase encoded by human FUT4 gene and does not resemble the product of the FUT5 gene. Although FUT1 is expressed in the COS cell mRNA, it has not been possible to demonstrate alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase activity in cell extracts but the presence of Le(y) and blood-group A antigenic determinants on the cell surface imply the formation of H-precursor structures at some stage. The most strongly expressed fucosyltransferase in the COS cells is the alpha1,6-enzyme transferring fucose to the innermost N -acetylglucosamine unit in N -glycan chains; this enzyme is similar in its properties to the product of the human FUT8 gene. The enzymes resembling the human FUT4 and FUT8 gene products both had pH optima of 7.0 and were resistant to 10 mM NEM. The incorporation of fucose into asialo-fetuin was optimal at 5.5 and was inhibited by 10 mM NEM. This result initially suggested the presence of a third fucosyltransferase expressed in the COS cells but we have now shown that triantennary N- glycans with terminal nonreducing galactose units, similar to those present in asialo-fetuin, are modified by a weak endogenous beta-galactosidase in the COS cell extracts and thereby rendered suitable substrates for the alpha1,6-fucosyltransferase.
