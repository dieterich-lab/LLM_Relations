Careful examination of the kinetics data revealed a surprising discrepancy (Figure 1Q). If the binding of nucleotides to the Rag GTPases involves a single transition state, the dissociation constant, and the on- and off-rates should conform to the equation Kd = koff / kon. This prediction holds true for GDP, where the calculated koff matches well with the measured koff (Figure 1Q), suggesting that GDP binding does indeed overcome one transition state (Figure 1R). However, the measured koff for GTP is 1300- and 46-fold slower than the calculated one for RagA and RagC, respectively (Figure 1Q, GTP koff, calc vs. koff, measured). This discrepancy suggests that the binding of GTP, but not GDP, induces conformational changes in the heterodimer beyond the local ones on Switch I/II that are common to small GTP binding proteins, and that these prevent GTP dissociation (Figure 1S). To our knowledge this second transition state has not been observed in monomeric GTPases, suggesting that it is a result of the heterodimeric architecture of the Rag GTPases.
