Hyperactive NF-kappaB has been linked to the development and progression of many types of cancer. To investigate potential roles for SETD6 and SETD6-RelA interplay in cellular transformation, U2OS cells were established that stably expressed shRNAs targeting SETD6 alone, RelA alone, SETD6 and RelA, or a control shRNA, and tested for cell transformation-associated properties (Fig. 3a,b; Supplementary Fig. 14). Relative to the control, knockdown of SETD6 accelerated proliferation rates of cells in a RelA-dependent fashion (Fig. 3a). In addition, SETD6 depletion conferred a 25-fold increase in the ability of cells to form colonies in soft agar relative to control and RelA-depleted cells, and co-depletion of RelA with SETD6 reversed the anchorage-independent growth advantage provided by SETD6 knockdown alone (Fig. 3b). Depletion of SETD6 also led to an increase in cell proliferation rates in mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 cells, but not in Rela-/- 3T3 cells (Fig. 3c). Next, endogenous SETD6 was depleted in U2OS and mouse 3T3 cells employing shRNAs targeting the 3' UTR of human or mouse SETD6, respectively (Fig. 3d,e). The SETD6-depleted cells were reconstituted with exogenous SETD6 or SETD6Y285A that lacked the 3' UTR and was therefore shRNA-resistant. Complementation with wild-type SETD6 reestablished a normal proliferative rate, while SETD6Y285A complementation failed to do so (Fig. 3d,e). These data suggest that the enzymatic activity of SETD6 regulates a RelA-dependent effect on cell proliferation.
