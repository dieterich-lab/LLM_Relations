One interesting observation consistent in all hRio2 knockdown experiments in the different cell lines was an obvious cytoplasmic accumulation of 40S trans-acting factors in many cells (Fig. 4 and Fig. S3). This observation was particularly striking in HeLaK cells, in which we did not even observe nucleoplasmic accumulation of these proteins. Thus, HeLaK cells turned out to be a suitable model to further study these effects independently of nuclear export defects. Indeed, immunofluorescence analysis of hRio2-depleted HeLaK cells revealed that ~90% of cells displayed a partial cytoplasmic accumulation of hEnp1 and hDim2, which are restricted to the nucleus in control cells (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, both hNob1 and hLtv1 appeared to be more strongly cytoplasmic after hRio2 knockdown (Fig. 5 A). Together, these results suggest that in the absence of hRio2, these four trans-acting factors are found on cytoplasmic 40S precursors that are stalled in their maturation.
