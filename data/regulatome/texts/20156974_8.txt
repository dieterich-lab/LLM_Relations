Two independent groups have demonstrated the ability of ADAM10 to cleave CD23 in vitro. These studies generated intriguing questions about the role of ADAM10 in the regulation of CD23-mediated immune responses. However, earlier in vitro experiments demonstrated the ability of ADAM8 and ADAM15 to cleave CD23. In addition, a recent study determined that MMP-9 is the principal sheddase of CD23 in LPS-treated mice. Given that many ADAM substrates, including Notch1 and CD23, can be cleaved by multiple proteases in vitro, the physiological relevance of ADAM10-mediated cleavage in B cells is unclear. This requires examination of ADAM10-null B cells from B cell-specific knockout mice.
