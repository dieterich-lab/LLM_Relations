To investigate the relationship among ERK signaling, TCF activation, and histone modifications, TKO MEFs were reconstituted with retroviruses expressing wild-type human Elk-1 or its inactive derivative Elk-1nonA, which cannot be phosphorylated, or Elk-1DeltaFW, which can be phosphorylated but cannot recruit Mediator (Figure 2C). All the derivatives generated similar ChIP-seq profiles, indicating that Elk-1 recruitment to SRF occurs independently of phosphorylation (; see also Figure S5C). Re-expression of wild-type Elk-1 was sufficient to restore TPA-induced chromatin changes at ~60% of TCF-dependent TSS regions (1,223 of 2,060) (Figures 2D, 2E, S4B, S4D, and S4E; Table S2), and at the vast majority of these (1,132 of 1,223) induced histone modifications required Elk-1 phosphorylation and its ability to recruit Mediator (Figures 2D, 2E, S4B, S4D, and S4E; Table S2A). Taken together, these results show that the majority of TPA-induced changes in histone modifications at TSSs are TCF dependent and require ERK-induced transcriptional activation by the TCFs.
