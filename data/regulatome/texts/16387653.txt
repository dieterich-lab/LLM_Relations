ING tumor suppressor proteins are critical regulators of chromatin acetylation required for genome expression and perpetuation.  Members of the ING family of tumor suppressors regulate cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and DNA repair as important cofactors of p53. ING1 and ING3 are stable components of the mSin3A HDAC and Tip60/NuA4 HAT complexes, respectively. We now report the purification of the three remaining human ING proteins. While ING2 is in an HDAC complex similar to ING1, ING4 associates with the HBO1 HAT required for normal progression through S phase and the majority of histone H4 acetylation in vivo. ING5 fractionates with two distinct complexes containing HBO1 or nucleosomal H3-specific MOZ/MORF HATs. These ING5 HAT complexes interact with the MCM helicase and are essential for DNA replication to occur during S phase. Our data also indicate that ING subunits are crucial for acetylation of chromatin substrates. Since INGs, HBO1, and MOZ/MORF contribute to oncogenic transformation, the multisubunit assemblies characterized here underscore the critical role of epigenetic regulation in cancer development.
