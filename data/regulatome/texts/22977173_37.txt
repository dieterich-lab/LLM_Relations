We next investigated the MRN-ATR-Chk1 arm of the replication checkpoint. MRN functions in checkpoint activation both as an upstream damage sensor and a downstream target of ATR . We reported that MRN co-localizes with RPA in cells treated with UV, HU and etoposide, the MRN-RPA interaction is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of these complexes, that an RPA-MRN interaction followed by RPA32 phosphorylation was required for etoposide-induced G2/M arrest, and that HU-induced phosphorylation of RPA32 by ATR requires NBS1. NBS1 also has an important role in etoposide-induced, ATR-dependent RPA32 hyperphosphorylation and PPA2-mediated RPA32 dephosphorylation of RPA32 Thr21 and Ser33 is required for checkpoint release and cell cycle re-entry. We found that etoposide-induced MRE11 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in UM-SCC-38 cells expressing S4A/S8A mutant RPA32 compared with WT, an effect comparable with that observed in cells expressing kinase-dead ATR (Figure 3B and C). Full ATR activation depends on its interaction with TopBP1, and specifically on phosphorylation of PIKK consensus sites in TopBP1's ATR activation domain. Thus, TopBP1 phosphorylation is important for replication checkpoint activation. Similar to MRE11, etoposide-induced TopBP1 phosphorylation was reduced in UM-SCC-38 cells to ~50% of WT levels in the S4A/S8A mutant (Figure 3B and C). These results indicate that RPA32 Ser4/Ser8 phosphorylation is a critical early step for full ATR activation in response to replication stress and subsequent replication checkpoint arrest.
