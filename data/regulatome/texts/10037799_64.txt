Perhaps the most striking distinction between LYVE-1 and CD44 is in their patterns of tissue expression. Intriguingly, the LYVE-1 molecule is largely if not exclusively restricted to lymph vessel endothelial cells from which CD44 is almost completely absent. Comprehensive analyses of a large panel of human tissues by immunoperoxidase staining with specific antisera revealed LYVE-1 lining the lymphatics in virtually every tissue where these structures could be distinguished, and included vessels draining gastrointestinal tissues, skin, lymph nodes, breast, and salivary gland. The greatest concentration of LYVE-1 expression was seen in submucosal lymph vessels underlying smooth muscle in the colon, and the Lacteal vessels of intestinal villi that transport dietary lipid absorbed from the small intestine. Lymphatic vessels are morphologically distinguishable from blood vessels by their reduced or missing basement membrane and lack of erythrocyte content. There are currently no specific immunochemical markers that allow identification of lymphatics, although limited studies with endothelial markers indicate differential expression of the L-selectin ligand CD34 and the coagulation Factor VIII-related protein vWF. Our own results using double immunofluorescence indicate that LYVE-1 defines a set of lymphatic vessels which express neither CD34 nor vWF and identify LYVE-1 as a powerful new marker for future studies of lymphatic structure and function.
