As shown previously for the neural tube, Tctn1 was epistatic to Shh in limb bud patterning (Figure 1l). Compared to controls, Tctn1-/- embryos had markedly increased levels of full length Gli3 (Gli3-FL), suggesting that Gli3 processing is compromised (Figure 1m). These results indicate that, although Tctn1 is not required for ciliogenesis in the limb bud, it is required for cilium-dependent Hh signal transduction.
