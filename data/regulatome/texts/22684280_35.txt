Heterochromatin protein 1 has been implicated in a diverse array of cellular processes, including heterochromatin formation, gene silencing, DNA damage repair, telomere stability, and RNAi-mediated silencing. Here, we provide evidence that in human cells CBX3 supports transcription and efficient splicing. We demonstrate that CBX3 is localized to the gene body of the most actively transcribed genes. We observe that CBX3 preferentially associates with exons in multiple-exon genes. Knockdown of CBX3 expression results in down-regulation of a subset of target genes and significant accumulation of unspliced transcripts from greater than 1000 transcripts. Depletion of CBX3 also causes a defect in recruitment of splicing factors SNRNP70 and SRSF1 to the CBX3 target gene IL1A. This is suggestive of a role for CBX3 in RNA processing through recruitment or stabilization of spliceosome components to at least a subset of target genes.
