The nuclear receptors LXRalpha and LXRbeta work in a complementary fashion with SREBPs to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. When cellular cholesterol levels rise, oxysterols are formed and serve as ligands for LXRs. Activation of LXR by oxysterols, particularly 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, induces the expression of genes encoding proteins essential for cholesterol efflux from cells, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1, phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), ADP-ribosylation factor-like 7 (ARL7) and apolipoprotein (Apo)E. The expression of these factors promotes the transfer of excess intracellular cholesterol to extracellular acceptors, such as ApoA-I, ApoE and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), thereby facilitating reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues.
