To determine whether ES-cell-specific genes were induced in the human fibroblast nuclei, the induction of human OCT4 and NANOG was assayed relative to ubiquitous GAPDH using species-specific primers (Supplementary Fig. 4). Messenger RNA isolated from sorted heterokaryons 1, 2 and 3 days after fusion was assessed by reverse transcription followed by semiquantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR (Fig. 2a,b). The day 0 controls tested initially were (1) human fibroblasts alone, (2) pre-PEG, unfused co-cultures of mouse ES cells and human fibroblasts, or (3) human fibroblasts treated with PEG to control for the effects of PEG and fusion. All of these day 0 controls gave similar results (data not shown) and the unfused co-culture control was used for all subsequent experiments. Notably, the induction of both human OCT4 and NANOG transcripts was evident as early as day 1 after fusion in heterokaryons but not in controls (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating that the onset of expression of two key human pluripotency genes is rapid in heterokaryons. By day 1, expression of human OCT4 and NANOG (normalized to GAPDH in the same samples), had increased 5-fold relative to the control (day 0) and persisted at 10-fold higher levels on days 2 and 3 (Fig. 2b). Human-specific primers were used to determine whether other key pluripotency genes in addition to OCT4 and NANOG were induced using real-time PCR, including KLF4, ESRRB, TDGF1 (also known as CRIPTO), SOX2 and c-Myc (also known as MYC) (Supplementary Fig. 6). ESRRB and TDGF1 (ref.), which have been shown to be essential for maintaining ES cell self-renewal and are targets of OCT4 and NANOG, were found to be upregulated 3-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively, in heterokaryons on day 2 after fusion (Supplementary Fig. 6). SOX2 is already expressed in human fibroblasts and its promoter is extensively demethylated pre-fusion, in agreement with findings in mouse fibroblasts; its expression did not increase after fusion. Expression of KLF4 (ref.), which is functionally interchangeable with ESRRB, did not change in heterokaryons at day 2 after fusion (Supplementary Fig. 6).
