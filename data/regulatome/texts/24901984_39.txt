We next determined whether NM1 is a GSK3beta-dependent substrate for ubiquitination. For this purpose cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encompassing a HA-tagged version of the ubiquitin open reading frame. Following expression of the HA-ubiquitin, cells were arrested in G1 by serum starvation and treated with MG132. We prepared total lysates and subjected them to immunoprecipitations with the anti-NM1 antibody. The fractions of co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on immunoblots for HA-tagged ubiquitin. The results show that in contrast to GSK3beta+/+ MEFs, in G1 lysates from GSK3beta-/- MEFs treated with MG132, NM1 becomes polyubiquitinated (Figure 6A). NM1 polyubiquitination was not detected in lysates from growing GSK3beta-/- MEFs even in the presence of MG132 (Figure S8A), whereas in lysates prepared from growing GSK3beta+/+ MEFs or HEK293T cells NM1 appears to be polyubiquitinated (Figure S8B-C). To confirm these results in an independent cellular system, HeLa cells were incubated with a master mix containing the HA-tagged ubiquitin plasmid and siRNA oligonucleotides for specific GSK3beta gene silencing (GSK3beta RNAi) or control scrambled siRNA oligonucleotides (scrRNAi) (Figure 6B; Figure S2). HeLa cells were maintained at G1 by serum starvation and were treated with MG132. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitations with anti-NM1 antibodies and the co-immunoprecipitated protein fractions were analyzed on immunoblots for HA-tagged ubiquitin. The results show a marked increase in the levels of endogenous NM1 polyubiquitination in lysates of GSK3beta-silenced HeLa cells treated with MG132 (Figure 6B, lanes 3 and 6). We conclude that NM1 polyubiquitination is dependent on GSK3beta only at G1.
