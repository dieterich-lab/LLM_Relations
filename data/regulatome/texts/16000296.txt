DHHC9 and GCP16 constitute a human protein fatty acyltransferase with specificity for H- and N-Ras.  Covalent lipid modifications mediate the membrane attachment and biological activity of Ras proteins. All Ras isoforms are farnesylated and carboxyl-methylated at the terminal cysteine; H-Ras and N-Ras are further modified by palmitoylation. Yeast Ras is palmitoylated by the DHHC cysteine-rich domain-containing protein Erf2 in a complex with Erf4. Here we report that H- and N-Ras are palmitoylated by a human protein palmitoyltransferase encoded by the ZDHHC9 and GCP16 genes. DHHC9 is an integral membrane protein that contains a DHHC cysteine-rich domain. GCP16 encodes a Golgi-localized membrane protein that has limited sequence similarity to yeast Erf4. DHHC9 and GCP16 co-distribute in the Golgi apparatus, a location consistent with the site of mammalian Ras palmitoylation in vivo. Like yeast Erf2.Erf4, DHHC9 and GCP16 form a protein complex, and DHHC9 requires GCP16 for protein fatty acyltransferase activity and protein stability. Purified DHHC9.GCP16 exhibits substrate specificity, palmitoylating H- and N-Ras but not myristoylated G (alphai1) or GAP-43, proteins with N-terminal palmitoylation motifs. Hence, DHHC9.GCP16 displays the properties of a functional human ortholog of the yeast Ras palmitoyltransferase.
