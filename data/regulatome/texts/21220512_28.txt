The TGN plays a central role in protein sorting and receives proteins by retrograde transport from the endosomes. Our results indicate that ORP5 knockdown causes cholesterol accumulation in the endosomes, resulting in partial disruption of the retrograde transport pathway (Fig. 5). To investigate this further, we examined the localization of the CI-MPR, which is recycled between LE and TGN but is mostly present in the TGN at steady-state. HeLa cells depleted of NPC1 or ORP5 were double-stained for endogenous CI-MPR or the Golgi marker Golgin 97. CI-MPR, but not Golgin 97, showed a much more dispersed localization in cells depleted for ORP5 than normal cells or cells depleted for NPC1 (Fig. 6, A and B). Consistent with these observations, the green fluorescence profile (CI-MPR) was much broader in ORP5 knockdown cells than that in control or NPC1 knockdown cells (Fig. 6 A, right). We also performed a CI-MPR antibody internalization assay to monitor the endosomal trafficking of endogenous CI-MPR in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 6 C, depletion of ORP5 has much more severe effects on retrograde transport of CI-MPR than that of NPC1 depletion. We next examined the effects of ORP5 depletion on the trafficking of TGN46 and Shiga toxin subunit B (STxB), two other model cargos that cycle between the PM and TGN. Both TGN46 and STxB reach the TGN via early but not LEs, whereas STxB may also transit through the recycling endosomes. In contrast to NPC1 depletion, ORP5 knockdown caused dramatic, dispersed distribution of TGN46 (Fig. 6, D and E). Neither NPC1 nor ORP5 knockdown, however, had any apparent effect on the trafficking of STxB to the TGN (Fig. 6 F). These results suggest that ORP5 knockdown affects trafficking events through early and late but probably not recycling endosomes. The trafficking defects could likely result from the accumulation of LDL-C in endosomal compartments in the absence of ORP5.
